## 🟡 Current Errors in Production

### Error 1: Admin pages not loading (post-rollback incident)
```
https://www.amanoba.com/en/admin
https://www.amanoba.com/en/admin/courses
```

**Observed**:
- Build failed on Vercel with JSX parse error in OG certificate render route
- Admin routes did not load while deployment failed

**Root Cause**:
- Commit `1d4d18a` introduced `app/api/certificates/[certificateId]/render/route.tsx` with inline JSX
- Vercel build pipeline treated the module as `.ts` during compilation, producing `Expected '>', got 'style'` and failing the build

**Resolution**:
- Reverted all commits after `3cbba4a` to return to last known good state
- Pushed rollback to `main` and verified local `npm run build` passes

### Error 2: Anonymous Login
```
https://amanoba.com/auth/signin
"Failed to create anonymous session"
```

**API Response**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://amanoba.com/api/auth/anonymous
{"success":false,"error":"Failed to create anonymous session"}
```

### Error 3: Facebook Login
```
https://amanoba.com/auth/signin
"Server Configuration Error
There is a problem with the server configuration. Please contact support."
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The errors persist because **ONE or MORE** of these issues:

### Issue 1: Vercel Not Redeployed Yet ⚠️
**Symptoms**: Same errors after pushing fixes  
**Cause**: Vercel auto-deploy might be disabled or taking too long  
**Solution**: Manually trigger redeploy in Vercel dashboard

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Missing ⚠️
**Symptoms**: Both auth methods fail  
**Cause**: Critical env vars not set in Vercel production environment  
**Solution**: Add all required variables to Vercel

### Issue 3: Old Build Cache ⚠️
**Symptoms**: Recent code changes not reflected  
**Cause**: Vercel using cached build with old code  
**Solution**: Redeploy WITHOUT cache

### Issue 4: JSX Parse Error in API Route ⚠️
**Symptoms**: Build fails with `Expected '>', got 'style'` in certificate render route  
**Cause**: Inline JSX in a route file that Vercel compiled as `.ts`  
**Solution**: Keep JSX out of `.ts` files or use `jsx/jsxs` helpers; validate with `npm run build` before deploy

---

## ✅ Fail-Safe Recovery Plan (Error-Free Delivery)

1. **Freeze main**: no feature changes while production is unstable.
2. **Rollback first**: return to last known good commit (`3cbba4a`) and redeploy without cache.
3. **Rebuild in isolation**: reintroduce features in a feature branch only.
4. **Local validation**: run `npm run build` before every merge.
5. **Deploy with clean cache**: redeploy on Vercel with “Use existing Build Cache” unchecked.
6. **Post-deploy smoke check**: verify `/en/admin`, `/en/admin/courses`, and key APIs.
7. **Document immediately**: update `docs/LEARNINGS.md` and `docs/PRODUCTION_STATUS.md` after each change.

## 📋 MANUAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### ✅ Step 1: Check Vercel Dashboard

Go to: **https://vercel.com/[your-username]/amanoba/deployments**

**Verify**:
- [ ] Latest deployment shows commit hash `745dbfc` or `2d8b91c`
- [ ] Deployment status is "Ready" (green checkmark)
- [ ] Deployment timestamp is recent (after 2025-01-14 11:15:00 UTC)
- [ ] No build errors in deployment logs

**If NO**:
- Wait 2-3 minutes for auto-deploy
- OR manually trigger redeploy (see Step 3)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Go to: **https://vercel.com/[your-username]/amanoba/settings/environment-variables**

**Required Variables for Production**:

| Variable | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | `<32-char base64 string>` | ❓ |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://amanoba.com` | ❓ |
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb+srv://playmass:xeDfip-7gavvo-betgab@playmass-cluster.lbzmcrq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=playmass-cluster` | ❓ |
| `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` | `1522241068777501` | ❓ |
| `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` | `36f35cfc31152fbe9fba13ab76908f4c` | ❓ |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | ❓ |

**If ANY are missing**:

1. Click "Add New" variable
2. Enter Name and Value
3. Select "Production" environment
4. Click "Save"
5. Trigger redeploy after adding variables

**Generate AUTH_SECRET if missing**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
# Copy output and add to Vercel
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Manual Redeploy (Force Fresh Build)

**Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard** (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/amanoba/deployments
2. Find the LATEST deployment in the list
3. Click the **⋯** (three dots menu) on the right
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. **CRITICAL**: Uncheck ✅ "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **"Redeploy"** button
7. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

**Option B: Via Git Push** (Already Done)
```bash
# Already executed - commit 745dbfc pushed
# This should trigger auto-deploy
# Wait 2-3 minutes and check deployments
```

**Option C: Via Vercel CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# This will build and deploy immediately
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Wait for Deployment

**While waiting** (2-3 minutes):
- Watch deployment progress in Vercel dashboard
- Check for any build errors
- Look for "Deployment Ready" notification

**Build Logs should show**:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**If build fails**:
- Check error messages in build logs
- Verify package.json dependencies
- Check for TypeScript errors

---

### ✅ Step 5: Test After Successful Deployment

**Wait until**: Deployment status = "Ready" ✅

#### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://amanoba.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","database":"connected"}
```

#### Test 2: Anonymous Login API
```bash
curl -X POST https://amanoba.com/api/auth/anonymous
# Expected: {"success":true,"credentials":{...},"player":{...}}
```

#### Test 3: Anonymous Login UI
1. Visit: https://amanoba.com/auth/signin
2. Click "Continue Without Registration"
3. **Expected**: Random 3-word username + redirect to dashboard
4. **NOT Expected**: "Failed to create anonymous session"

#### Test 4: Facebook Login UI
1. Visit: https://amanoba.com/auth/signin
2. Click "Sign in with Facebook"
3. Authorize app (if prompted)
4. **Expected**: Redirect to dashboard with Facebook profile
5. **NOT Expected**: "Server Configuration Error"

## 🐛 Debugging Production Errors

If errors persist after redeployment and all env vars are set:

### Check Vercel Function Logs

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/amanoba/deployments
2. Click on the LATEST "Ready" deployment
3. Click **"Functions"** tab
4. Click on `/api/auth/anonymous` function
5. Look for error messages in logs

**Common errors to look for**:
- `No guest usernames available` → Database seed issue (✅ fixed)
- `Player validation failed` → Schema mismatch (✅ fixed)
- `Cannot connect to MongoDB` → Wrong MONGODB_URI
- `No active brand found` → Database not seeded (✅ fixed)
- `Error: the worker has exited` → Logger issue (✅ fixed)

### Check Browser Console

1. Open https://amanoba.com/auth/signin
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try anonymous login
5. Look for fetch errors or 500 responses

### Check Network Requests

1. Open Developer Tools → Network tab
2. Click "Continue Without Registration"
3. Find POST request to `/api/auth/anonymous`
4. Check Response tab for detailed error
5. Check Headers tab for status code

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Production is fully working when:

- ✅ Latest commit deployed (745dbfc or newer)
- ✅ All environment variables set
- ✅ Build completed without errors
- ✅ Anonymous login API returns success
- ✅ Anonymous login UI creates session
- ✅ Facebook login redirects to dashboard
- ✅ Dashboard accessible after login
- ✅ Games load and play correctly
- ✅ No 500 errors in Vercel logs
- ✅ No console errors in browser

---

## 📞 Next Steps if Still Failing

If after completing ALL steps above, errors persist:

1. **Share Vercel deployment URL** with specific commit hash
2. **Share environment variables list** (names only, not values)
3. **Share Vercel function logs** for `/api/auth/anonymous`
4. **Share browser console errors** when testing login
5. **Check MongoDB Atlas** logs for connection issues

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**What YOU need to do**:

1. **Go to Vercel dashboard** → Check if latest commit deployed
2. **Go to Vercel settings** → Verify all 6 environment variables exist
3. **Trigger redeploy** → Without cache, wait for completion
4. **Test both login methods** → Should work after fresh deploy

**What I've done**:
- ✅ Fixed all code issues
- ✅ Pushed all fixes to GitHub
- ✅ Seeded production database
- ✅ Triggered redeploy via empty commit
- ✅ Documented all steps

**The issue is now in Vercel's hands** - the code is ready, database is ready, we just need Vercel to deploy it! 🚀
