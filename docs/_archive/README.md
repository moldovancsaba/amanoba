# Docs Archive

This folder holds **non-canonical** documentation that we keep only for **historical context**:

- Dated delivery / audit docs
- Generated tasklists and snapshots
- One-off reports, execution logs, and superseded plans

**Rules**

- Do not link to archived docs from core docs unless there is a strong reason.
- If an archived doc is referenced, prefer linking to a **canonical summary** (e.g. `docs/product/RELEASE_NOTES.md`) and keep the archive link as a secondary reference.
- New archival moves should be reflected in `docs/core/DOCS_CANONICAL_MAP.md`.
