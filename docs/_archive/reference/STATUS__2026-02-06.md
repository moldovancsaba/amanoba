## 🎯 Current State Summary

Amanoba is operating as a **30-day learning platform** with:

- Multi-locale UI (11 locales): `hu`, `en`, `ar`, `hi`, `id`, `pt`, `vi`, `tr`, `bg`, `pl`, `ru`
- Course package v2 export/import (merge-safe) for course content + configuration
- Certification tooling with pass rules and certificate template A/B design support
- Enrolment API with prerequisites (hard/soft enforcement) and multiple concurrent enrolments supported by `CourseProgress` (one per player per course)
- Quiz system support for 3-option delivery (1 correct + 2 wrong, shuffled) and configurable pass/fail rules

## ✅ Notable Progress Since 2026-01-28 Snapshot

- **i18n routing stability**: Unified routing config and prevented double-locale URLs; language switcher fixed (see `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` v2.9.43).
- **UI translations expanded**: Added full UI translations for `ar`, `hi`, `ru`, `id`, `pt` (see `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` v2.9.44).
- **Course package v2**: Documented format and implemented export/import merge behavior to preserve stats and progress (see `docs/COURSE_PACKAGE_FORMAT.md` and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`).
- **Prerequisites**: Enrolment API now supports prerequisite enforcement for course sequencing (see `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`).

## 🚧 Active Work / Next Focus (from `docs/TASKLIST.md`)

- **P2 Multiple courses UI**: Dashboard/course pages need to correctly surface all courses in progress and prerequisite notices.
- **P2 Email/scheduler multi-course**: Daily lesson delivery must respect multiple enrolments without duplicates.
- **P3+ Roadmap items**: Email automation A/B, richer leaderboards, mobile/offline, live sessions (future).
