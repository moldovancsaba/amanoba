# Amanoba Task List

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-28

This document lists **actionable tasks** derived from the roadmap and current backlog. Each item is something to do. When a task is completed, move it to **RELEASE_NOTES.md** and remove it from this list. Ideas and vision live in **ROADMAP.md**. Completed work lives only in RELEASE_NOTES (not here).

Completed items (formerly 1–4, 6–11) are not listed here; they live only in **RELEASE_NOTES.md**.

## Action Items (priority order)

### Email automation Phase 2 (from ROADMAP)

1. (Optional) Add A/B testing for key emails; (optional) MailerLite/ActiveCampaign integration per ROADMAP.

---

### Further course achievements and leaderboards (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want additional course achievements and richer course-specific leaderboards so that I have clear milestones and can compare my progress with others on the same course.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | (Optional) Add more leaderboard metrics (e.g. consistency) — course_points and course_completion_speed already exist. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 2 | ~~Expose course-specific leaderboards in UI~~ — Done: course detail page shows course leaderboard (top 10 by points). | ✅ |

---

### Course and content voting — additional (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want to up/down vote courses and see aggregate scores on course cards and lesson headers; as an admin I want to see vote aggregates and have votes reset when content is updated, so that we see which content is most helpful and quality improves from feedback.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | ~~Add up/down voting for courses~~ — Done: ContentVoteWidget (targetType=course) on course detail. | ✅ |
| 2 | ~~Store and expose aggregate vote scores for courses~~ — Done: GET /api/votes; GET /api/courses?includeVoteAggregates=1. | ✅ |
| 3 | ~~Display aggregate scores on course cards~~ — Done: course cards show ↑/↓ count when voteAggregate present. | ✅ |
| 4 | ~~Admin view~~ — Done: /admin/votes. | ✅ |
| 5 | ~~Reset votes when lesson content is updated~~ — Done: resetVotesForLesson from admin lesson PATCH. | ✅ |

### UI/UX polish and reliability (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want improved course cards, lesson viewer, and progress visualisation and a consistent experience on mobile; as an admin I want better email templates and assessment result visuals; and as engineering we want smoke tests for critical paths so that the product stays reliable and we have fewer regressions.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | ~~Improve course cards~~ — Done: vote aggregate (↑/↓) on cards; layout already responsive. | ✅ |
| 2 | ~~Improve lesson viewer and progress visualisation~~ — Done: "Day X / Y" + thin progress bar in header. | ✅ |
| 3 | Improve mobile responsiveness across course/lesson flows. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 4 | Improve email templates (layout, clarity, branding). | ⏳ PENDING |
| 5 | Improve assessment result visuals (feedback, scores, explanations). | ⏳ PENDING |
