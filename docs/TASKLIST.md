# Amanoba Task List

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-28

This document lists **actionable tasks** derived from the roadmap and current backlog. Each item is something to do. When a task is completed, move it to **RELEASE_NOTES.md** and remove it from this list. Ideas and vision live in **ROADMAP.md**. Completed work lives only in RELEASE_NOTES (not here).

Completed items (formerly 1–4, 6–11) are not listed here; they live only in **RELEASE_NOTES.md**.

## Action Items (priority order)

### Email automation Phase 2 (from ROADMAP)

1. (Optional) Add A/B testing for key emails; (optional) MailerLite/ActiveCampaign integration per ROADMAP.

---

### Further course achievements and leaderboards (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want additional course achievements and richer course-specific leaderboards so that I have clear milestones and can compare my progress with others on the same course.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | (Optional) Add more leaderboard metrics (e.g. consistency) — course_points and course_completion_speed already exist. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 2 | ~~Expose course-specific leaderboards in UI~~ — Done: course detail page shows course leaderboard (top 10 by points). | ✅ |

---

### Course and content voting — additional (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want to up/down vote courses and see aggregate scores on course cards and lesson headers; as an admin I want to see vote aggregates and have votes reset when content is updated, so that we see which content is most helpful and quality improves from feedback.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Add up/down voting for courses (in addition to existing content voting). | ⏳ PENDING |
| 2 | Store and expose aggregate vote scores for courses. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 3 | Display aggregate scores (or indicators) on course cards and lesson headers. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 4 | Admin view: list/view vote aggregates for courses and content. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 5 | Reset votes when lesson content is updated (per policy). | ⏳ PENDING |

---

### UI/UX polish and reliability (from ROADMAP)

**User story:** As a learner I want improved course cards, lesson viewer, and progress visualisation and a consistent experience on mobile; as an admin I want better email templates and assessment result visuals; and as engineering we want smoke tests for critical paths so that the product stays reliable and we have fewer regressions.

| # | Action item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Improve course cards (layout, info, responsiveness). | ⏳ PENDING |
| 2 | Improve lesson viewer and progress visualisation. | ⏳ PENDING |
| 3 | Improve mobile responsiveness across course/lesson flows. | ⏳ PENDING |
