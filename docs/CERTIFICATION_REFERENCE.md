# Certification — reference index

**Last updated**: 2026-02-04  
**Purpose**: Single entry for certificate/certification docs: current design vs dated plans.

---

## Current (source of truth)

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **CERTIFICATE_AB_TEST_DESIGN.md** | A/B test design: template variants, assignment at issue, tracking. |
| **CERTIFICATE_CREATION_GUIDE.md** | How to create and issue certificates. |

Implementation details (pass rules, admin UI, APIs) are in **ARCHITECTURE.md** and **RELEASE_NOTES.md**.

---

## Dated plans and logs (reference only)

Point-in-time delivery plans, rollbacks, and audits. For current behaviour use the two docs above and RELEASE_NOTES.

- `2026-01-23_CERTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md`
- `2026-01-25_CERTIFICATION_*` (implementation log, rollback, stabilization, handover, V1/V2 complete, baseline verification, failure root causes, enhancements plan, simple certification plan, admin certificate list, verification slug delivery)
- `2026-01-25_PROFILE_AND_CERTIFICATION_DELIVERY_PLAN.md`
- `CERTIFICATION_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md`, `CERTIFICATION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `certificate_dev_plan.md`, `certification_final_exam_plan*.md` (v2–v5)
