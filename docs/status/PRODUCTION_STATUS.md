# Production Status

**Status**: Informational snapshot (not incident-specific)

## Canonical Deployment Truth

- Production deployment is automated via GitHub integration.
- Shipping path is: commit -> push to `origin/main` -> automated Vercel production deploy.
- Manual Vercel CLI deploy is exception-only and should be used only when explicitly requested.

Reference:
- `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Current Verification Policy

After each production push:

1. Confirm latest commit SHA is deployed.
2. Verify baseline routes:
   - `/`
   - `/robots.txt`
   - `/sitemap.xml`
   - `/en/auth/signin`
3. Verify the feature area touched by the release.
4. Log completed changes in `docs/product/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
