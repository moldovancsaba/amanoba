### Courses Needing More Questions:
- Some Russian courses (B2B_SALES_2026_30_RU, SALES_PRODUCTIVITY_30_RU) - need Russian language support in content-based generator
- Some Productivity courses in various languages - may need language-specific question generation

### Next Steps:
1. Add Russian language support to content-based generator
2. Add support for other languages (Turkish, Bulgarian, Arabic, Hindi, etc.)
