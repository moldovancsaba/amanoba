- ✅ **Balanced Difficulty**: Mix of recall (60%), application (30%), and critical thinking (10%)
- ✅ **Language Quality**: Native-level industry terminology across all languages
- ✅ **Searchability**: UUID + hashtags for future filtering and anonymization

### Scope
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Courses** | 8 unique topics |
| **Language Variants** | 10-11 per course |
| **Course Instances** (in menu) | ~80-88 total |
| **Lessons per Course** | 30 lessons |
| **Total Lessons** | ~2,400 lessons |
| **Questions Currently** | 5 per lesson = ~12,000 questions |
| **Questions After Enhancement** | 7 per lesson = ~16,800 questions |
| **Questions to Add** | 2 per lesson = ~4,800 new questions |
| **Questions to Audit** | All ~12,000 existing questions |

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Database Schema Updates

**Current QuizQuestion Model** (before):
```javascript
{
  lessonId: String,
  question: String,
  options: [String], // 4 options
  correctIndex: Number,
  difficulty: Enum ['EASY', 'MEDIUM', 'HARD'],
  category: String,
  isCourseSpecific: Boolean,
  metadata: { createdAt: Date, updatedAt: Date }
}
```

**Updated QuizQuestion Model** (after):
```javascript
{
  uuid: String, // ← NEW: Hashed random UUID (v4) for anonymized references
  hashtags: [String], // ← NEW: Multi-level filtering tags
  lessonId: String,
  question: String,
  options: [String], // 4 options (MUST be exactly 4)
  correctIndex: Number,
  difficulty: Enum ['EASY', 'MEDIUM', 'HARD'], // Refers to #beginner, #intermediate, #advanced
  category: String,
  isCourseSpecific: Boolean,
  questionType: Enum ['recall', 'application', 'critical-thinking'], // ← NEW: Cognitive level
  metadata: { 
    createdAt: Date,
    updatedAt: Date,
    auditedAt: Date, // ← NEW: When this question was audited
    auditedBy: String // ← NEW: Reference to auditor (AI)
  }
}
```

### Hashtag System

**Structure**: `#category #difficulty #type #language`

**Example**:
```
Question: "What is the key to accountability?"
Hashtags: ["#accountability", "#beginner", "#recall", "#hu", "#all-languages"]
```

**Available Hashtags**:

| Category | Values |
|----------|--------|
| **Topic** | #productivity, #accountability, #decision-making, #teamwork, #motivation, #stress-management, #delegation, #energy-management, #goal-setting, #context-switching, #meetings, #skills, #technology, #creativity, #communication, #planning, #community, #habits, #values, #improvement |
| **Difficulty** | #beginner, #intermediate, #advanced |
| **Type** | #recall, #application, #critical-thinking |
| **Language** | #hu, #en, #tr, #bg, #pl, #vi, #id, #ar, #pt, #hi, #all-languages |

**Usage Rules**:
- Every question gets: 1 topic + 1 difficulty + 1 type + 1 language + 1 universal
- Hashtags are NOT displayed to users (backend only)
- Format: lowercase with # prefix, no spaces

### UUID Generation

**Standard**: UUID v4 (random, hashed)
**Format**: `a3f2b8e1-9c7d-4f2a-8e1c-3d9b5c7f2e1a`
**Encryption**: Store as-is (no additional hashing; UUID itself is anonymized)
**Usage**: For internal reference, filtering, and analytics

## 🔄 EXECUTION WORKFLOW (Per Audit Unit)

### Standard Operating Procedure for ONE Audit Unit

**Unit**: 1 Lesson × 1 Language (7 questions total after completion)

#### STEP 1: Extract
```
Input: Course ID, Lesson ID, Language Code
Output: Current 5 questions + question details
```

#### STEP 2: Audit Existing Questions (5 questions)

For each of the 5 current questions:
1. **Read** question, options, correct answer
2. **Evaluate** against checklist (Standalone? Value? Language? Difficulty?)
3. **Classify**: Keep / Rewrite / Replace
4. **Document**: Issues found, decision made

#### STEP 3: Create New Questions (2 questions)

1. **Identify gaps** in cognitive levels (recall/application/critical-thinking mix)
2. **Identify gaps** in topic coverage
3. **Write 2 NEW questions** that fill those gaps
4. **Ensure** different difficulty levels
5. **Ensure** different cognitive types

#### STEP 4: Quality Review

Apply full checklist (above) to all 7 questions

#### STEP 5: Assign UUIDs & Hashtags

For each of 7 questions:
1. Generate UUID v4
2. Assign hashtags: #topic #difficulty #type #language
3. Set questionType field: 'recall' | 'application' | 'critical-thinking'
4. Set metadata.auditedAt: current date/time
5. Set metadata.auditedBy: 'AI-Developer'

#### STEP 6: Validate

- [ ] 7 questions total
- [ ] 4 options each
- [ ] All UUIDs unique
- [ ] All hashtags valid
- [ ] Mix correct (60/30/10)
- [ ] Language native-quality
- [ ] All standalone

#### STEP 7: Save to Database

Update MongoDB with all 7 questions (7 upsert operations or 1 bulk update)

#### STEP 8: Sign-off

```
Audit Unit: [Course] - [Lesson] - [Language]
Timestamp: [Date/Time]
Questions Audited: 5
Questions Added: 2
Questions Total: 7
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
```

## 📌 RULES & CONSTRAINTS (STRICT - DO NOT DEVIATE)

### Hard Rules

1. **NO Shortcuts**: Every question must pass full checklist
2. **NO Filler**: Every question must teach something
3. **NO Stupid Answers**: Wrong options must be plausible
4. **NO Standalone Violations**: Questions cannot reference other questions
5. **NO Language Mixing**: Each question stays in its original language
6. **NO Unapproved Changes**: AI cannot change course content/structure without approval
7. **NO Partial Saves**: Either all 7 questions pass, or rollback entire unit
8. **NO Loss of Data**: Always backup before DB migration

### Language Quality Standards

**Minimum Requirement**: Industry-standard terminology + native-speaker natural flow

**Research Process**:
1. Industry terminology glossaries (IT, business, marketing)
2. Native speaker reference materials
3. Official course content from Days 1-11 (gold standard)
4. Consistency with existing lesson content

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Translation artifacts (e.g., "What is the X?" in Hungarian when it should be different structure)
- ❌ Uncommon words when common synonyms exist
- ❌ Grammar inconsistencies
- ❌ Inconsistency with lesson content

### Cognitive Mix Rules

**Per 7-question set**:
- 4-5 questions @ #recall (60%)
- 2-3 questions @ #application (30%)
- 0-1 questions @ #critical-thinking (10%)

**Definition**:
- **Recall**: "What is X?" "Define Y" (requires remembering facts)
- **Application**: "Which scenario demonstrates X?" "How would you use X?" (apply knowledge to real cases)
- **Critical Thinking**: "Why is X better than Y?" "What would happen if?" (analyze, synthesize, evaluate)

### Database Rules

1. **Idempotent**: Running same audit twice produces same result
2. **Traceable**: Every change logged with timestamp + auditor
3. **Recoverable**: If process fails, can restart from last checkpoint
4. **Versioned**: Keep history of question changes
5. **Validated**: No corrupt data enters database

---

## 🚨 SAFETY & RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Checkpoint System

Save progress checkpoint after EACH completed audit unit (lesson):

```json
{
  "checkpoint": {
    "phase": 1,
    "course": "Productivity 2026",
    "lesson": 5,
    "language": "EN",
    "completed_at": "2026-01-24T14:30:00Z",
    "total_units_completed": 42,
    "total_questions_audited": 210,
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

### Rollback Procedure

**If error or failure occurs during a unit**:

1. **Stop** all operations
2. **Identify** which audit unit failed
3. **Revert** that unit to pre-audit state
4. **Log** error details
5. **Restart** from last successful checkpoint
6. **Report** issue for resolution

**Restore Last Known Good State**:
```bash
# Revert to last checkpoint
db.quizzes.updateMany(
  { checkpoint: { $lt: LAST_SUCCESSFUL_CHECKPOINT } },
  { $restore: PREVIOUS_VERSION }
)
```

## 📚 ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE (READ CAREFULLY)

### Question Quality Principles

1. **Standalone is Sacred**: No question can assume context from previous questions or lesson
2. **Teaching > Testing**: Every question should educate, not just measure
3. **Plausibility Matters**: Wrong answers should seem reasonable to a learner (then teach why they're wrong)
4. **Language Precision**: Industry terminology must be exact, not approximated

### Cognitive Science Basis

- **60% Recall**: Foundation - students must know facts
- **30% Application**: Transfer - students can use knowledge in new situations
- **10% Critical Thinking**: Mastery - students can analyze and create

This mix ensures learning progression from basic to advanced.

### Language Quality Framework

- **Terminology**: Use industry-standard glossaries
- **Grammar**: Native speaker standards
- **Flow**: Sentences should read naturally in the language
- **Consistency**: Match the tone/style of Days 1-11 content

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: "Which of the following is not true about..."  
✅ **Do**: "What is the primary benefit of..."

❌ **Don't**: Write question assuming lesson content memory  
✅ **Do**: Provide all necessary context in the question

❌ **Don't**: Make wrong answers obviously wrong  
✅ **Do**: Make wrong answers plausible but ultimately incorrect

❌ **Don't**: Skip language review  
✅ **Do**: Verify native-quality language for every question
