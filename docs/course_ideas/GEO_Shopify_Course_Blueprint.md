# GEO for Shopify: The Complete Course (30 Steps)

## 1) Course Goal

Enable a Shopify merchant to:
- Understand what GEO is and how it differs from SEO
- Build Shopify product and content foundations that generative systems can reliably retrieve, interpret, and cite
- Improve the likelihood of product inclusion in AI shopping answers
- Measure outcomes with a repeatable process
- Prepare the store for merchant programs and product feed workflows where available

Scope note:
- GEO improves visibility and citation probability. Direct in-chat checkout depends on each platform’s merchant programs, eligibility rules, and region availability.

## 2) Target Learner and Prerequisites

Target learner:
- Ecommerce operator, marketer, or product owner working on a Shopify store

Prerequisites:
- Admin access to Shopify
- Ability to edit product data and theme content (or coordinate with someone who can)
- Basic understanding of product pages, collections, and merchant feeds

## 3) Course Format

- 30 lessons total
- 20 to 30 minutes per day
- Each lesson ends with tasks that create a concrete artifact inside the store
- Optional deepening is always included with real URLs

## 4) Teaching Principles

This course must feel like a guided training session, not a blog post.

Every lesson must:
- Teach one concrete, usable skill
- Use short paragraphs with visible section breaks
- Include at least 2 examples (good vs bad, or before vs after)
- Include 1 guided exercise and 1 independent exercise
- End with a checklist the learner can complete in Shopify
- Provide optional deepening links with real URLs

Strict rules:
- No wall of text
- No reference without a link
- No vague claims like “AI likes this” without stating what to check and how to measure it

## 5) Quiz Behaviour Specification

The quiz is a supportive learning tool, not a gatekeeper.

Rules:
- The quiz can be started only after the lesson is completed
- Only one question is visible at a time
- After each answer, the system shows immediate feedback
- If correct:
  - Show a short positive message (example: “Correct. Well done.”)
  - Proceed to the next question
- If incorrect:
  - Show a supportive message (example: “Not quite. Please review the lesson.”)
  - Redirect the learner back to the lesson content
  - Pause quiz progress
  - The learner must revisit the lesson before retrying
- All questions must be answered correctly in sequence
- No skipping
- Tone must always be encouraging and non-punitive

## 6) What “Success” Means (Metrics)

Primary GEO metrics (track weekly):
- Citation rate: how often your domain is cited or linked as a source in AI answers for your target prompts
- Inclusion rate: how often your products or brand are included in AI shopping style answers
- Coverage: how many of your priority prompts return any mention of your store
- Consistency: does inclusion repeat across multiple runs, or is it random

Commercial metrics (track weekly):
- AI referral traffic to product and collection pages (UTM-based where possible)
- Conversion rate from AI referrals
- Add-to-cart rate and checkout completion rate for AI referrals
- Returns and support tickets attributed to mismatched expectations (price, stock, shipping, sizing)

## 7) Core Concepts Used Throughout the Course

Key idea:
Generative systems tend to favor content that is easy to retrieve, easy to interpret, and safe to cite.

In this course, “GEO-ready” means the store provides:
- Clear, structured product information
- Stable canonical URLs and strong internal linking
- Clean, crawlable HTML and indexable content
- Accurate offers and policies (price, stock, shipping, returns)
- Trust signals (identity, support, returns, reviews where real)

## 8) The 30-Step Learning Path

### Module 1: Foundations (Days 1 to 6)

1. What GEO is in ecommerce, and what it is not
2. GEO vs SEO for Shopify stores
3. How AI changes buying journeys (from search list to answer plus recommendation)
4. “Sell in chat” explained (influence vs transact)
5. Platform landscape overview (ChatGPT shopping, Copilot shopping, Google AI features)
6. Define success: pick your GEO prompts and business KPIs

Deliverable by Day 6:
- Your GEO prompt set (30 to 50 prompts)
- Your KPI baseline sheet (one page)

### Module 2: Merchant and Data Readiness (Days 7 to 12)

7. Shopify product data audit (titles, descriptions, variants, identifiers)
8. Why product feeds matter, and what “offer truth” means
9. Product identifiers: SKU, GTIN, brand, variant structure, and common failure modes
10. Shipping and returns clarity: reduce ambiguity and mismatches
11. Trust signals: identity, policies, support, and proof
12. Build your “Merchant Readiness Checklist” and fix the top 10 gaps

Deliverable by Day 12:
- Completed product data audit checklist
- Merchant readiness checklist with top 10 fixes scheduled

### Module 3: GEO-Ready Shopify Pages (Days 13 to 20)

13. Product page blueprint that is easy to cite
14. Answer capsule: the top-of-page summary block (what, who for, not for)
15. Variant clarity: prevent size and color confusion in AI summaries
16. Collection pages as guides, not just grids
17. Structured data basics in Shopify (what to verify, what to avoid)
18. Offers and reviews: when and how to show them safely
19. Image and video GEO: alt text, file naming, and variant visuals
20. No thin product pages: minimum content standards and remediation plan

Deliverable by Day 20:
- 10 product pages rebuilt to the blueprint
- 1 collection page upgraded to a buying guide style page

### Module 4: Question-Driven Commerce Content (Days 21 to 26)

21. Ecommerce prompt intent mapping (best, vs, alternatives, how to choose, policy)
22. Buying guides: structure that AI can summarize without distortion
23. Comparison pages: honest tradeoffs and decision criteria
24. Use-case landing pages: gift, season, sport, workplace, budget
25. Off-site GEO: where external mentions help and where they harm
26. Anti-spam rules and quality control for AI-assisted content

Deliverable by Day 26:
- 2 buying guides
- 2 comparison pages
- 2 use-case landing pages
- A publishing quality checklist

### Module 5: Selling in AI Surfaces and Measurement (Days 27 to 30)

27. Product feed operations: update cadence, monitoring, error handling, data integrity
28. Merchant programs: eligibility, onboarding, constraints (platform-specific)
29. Measurement system: weekly GEO test run, logging, reporting
30. Capstone sprint: pick 1 collection and run an end-to-end GEO improvement cycle

Deliverable by Day 30:
- One end-to-end GEO sprint completed for a single collection
- Baseline vs 2-week comparison report format prepared
- A scale plan for the next 30 days

## 9) Capstone Sprint Specification

- 10 products within that collection

Required actions:
- Product data cleanup
- Answer capsule insertion and page blueprint alignment
- Collection page upgraded to a buying guide format

- Measurement run using your GEO prompt set

Required outputs:
- Before/after notes for each product page changed
- A one-page report containing:
  - Prompt set results summary
  - Inclusion and citation observations
