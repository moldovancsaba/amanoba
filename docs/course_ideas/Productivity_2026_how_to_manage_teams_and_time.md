# Course blueprint: Productivity 2026, 30 days

A 30-day course split into 6 standalone units (each unit can also ship as its own mini-course). Each day is designed to fit a 20 to 30 minute lesson pattern.

⸻

Unit 1 (Days 1–5): Productivity foundations and operating system

Standalone course name option: Personal Productivity OS

Goal: Build a practical productivity baseline: outcomes, constraints, energy, attention, and simple measurement.
	•	Day 1: Productivity definition: output, outcomes, and constraints
	•	Day 2: Time, energy, attention: what you manage in practice
	•	Day 3: Goal hierarchy: vision → outcomes → projects → next actions
	•	Day 4: Habits vs systems: why systems scale better
	•	Day 5: Measurement: simple weekly review metrics (throughput, focus blocks, carryover)

Deliverables: personal “operating rules”, weekly review checklist, baseline KPI list.

⸻

Unit 2 (Days 6–10): Task and commitment management (GTD done properly)

Standalone course name option: GTD for Modern Work

Goal: Build a reliable system that captures everything, clarifies next actions, and prevents mental load.
	•	Day 6: Capture: inboxes, triggers list, capture habits
	•	Day 7: Clarify: projects vs actions, definition of “next action”
	•	Day 8: Organise: contexts, tags, horizons, calendars, waiting-for
	•	Day 9: Review: daily reset and weekly review (non-negotiables)
	•	Day 10: Do: choosing work by context, time, energy, priority

Tables and templates:
	•	GTD capture sheet
	•	Projects list
	•	Next actions list
	•	Waiting-for list
	•	Weekly review template

⸻

Unit 3 (Days 11–15): Prioritisation frameworks and decision discipline

Standalone course name option: Decisions, Not To-Do Lists

Goal: Make prioritisation repeatable and defensible.
	•	Day 11: Eisenhower Matrix: urgent vs important, common traps
	•	Day 12: Impact vs effort: ICE, RICE, and when to use which
	•	Day 13: Opportunity cost and WIP: why “no” is a productivity tool
	•	Day 14: Personal and team goal alignment: OKRs and outcomes
	•	Day 15: Decision logs: reduce rework and debate loops

Tables and templates:
	•	Eisenhower Matrix
	•	Impact/Effort quadrant
	•	ICE scoring sheet
	•	Decision log (date, options, decision, rationale)

⸻

Unit 4 (Days 16–20): Visual work management (Kanban and flow)

Standalone course name option: Kanban for Humans

Goal: Run daily work with visibility and flow, not chaos.
	•	Day 16: Kanban basics: visualisation, WIP limits, flow
	•	Day 17: Designing your board: columns, policies, definitions of done
	•	Day 18: Managing flow: bottlenecks, ageing, blockers
	•	Day 19: Personal Kanban vs team Kanban: what changes and why
	•	Day 20: Metrics: cycle time, throughput, WIP, ageing work

Tables and templates:
	•	Kanban board layout
	•	WIP policy checklist
	•	Blocker log
	•	Cycle time tracker (simple)

⸻

Unit 5 (Days 21–25): Agile ways of working (Scrum vs Lean vs Kanban) + Tribes and Guilds

Standalone course name option: Agile Delivery Playbook

Goal: Choose and apply agile methods based on context, then scale collaboration using org patterns like tribes and guilds.
	•	Day 21: Agile principles: what matters, what is theatre
	•	Day 22: Scrum: when it works, when it fails, required conditions
	•	Day 23: Lean: waste reduction, continuous improvement, flow thinking
	•	Day 24: Choosing the method: a decision framework (team type, uncertainty, cadence, dependencies)
	•	Day 25: Scaling collaboration: tribes, squads, chapters, guilds (what they are used for, how to avoid bureaucracy)

Tables and templates:
	•	Method selection matrix (Scrum vs Kanban vs Lean vs Hybrid)
	•	Meeting/cadence template
	•	Tribe/Guild charter template (purpose, membership, cadence, outputs)

⸻

Unit 6 (Days 26–30): Strategy, alignment, and practical canvases

Standalone course name option: Work Design and Alignment

Goal: Use canvases to turn ideas into executable plans and align stakeholders.
	•	Day 26: Business Model Canvas: when to use, how to keep it real
	•	Day 27: Value Proposition Canvas: customer jobs, pains, gains
	•	Day 28: Strategy to execution: converting canvases into backlogs
	•	Day 29: Stakeholder alignment: communication, expectation setting, “definition of done”
	•	Day 30: Capstone: design your full system (personal + team), plan next 30 days

Tables and templates:
	•	Business Model Canvas
	•	Value Proposition Canvas
	•	Canvas-to-backlog mapping sheet
	•	Definition of Done checklist

⸻

What the learner finishes with
	•	A personal productivity OS (GTD + prioritisation + weekly review)
	•	A working Kanban system with WIP policies
	•	A clear decision framework for Scrum vs Lean vs Kanban
	•	A practical model for tribes and guilds (lightweight, non-bureaucratic)
	•	A set of reusable canvases and templates for alignment and execution

If you tell me the target audience (solo operators, product teams, sales teams, or mixed), I will tune the examples and the final capstone deliverable to match.
