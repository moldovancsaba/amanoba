**Deliverable:** Sport Sales Value Chain Map

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **produce a usable Sport Sales Value Chain Map and run a first sanity check**.

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] Sport Sales Value Chain Map exists and is saved
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] You can explain the key idea in one minute

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** Sport Sales Value Chain Map
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Value chain and stakeholder map for European B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Sport Sales Value Chain Map is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Buying Committee Map is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

**Time:** 20–30 min  
**Deliverable:** Objection Playbook

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **produce a usable Objection Playbook and run a first sanity check**.

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] Objection Playbook exists and is saved
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] You can explain the key idea in one minute

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** Objection Playbook
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Objection handling for European B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Objection Playbook is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Competition and differentiation for European B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Competitive Battlecard Set is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

# Lesson 23: EU tender discovery: TED, CPV taxonomy, and monitoring cadence

**One-liner:** Write outreach that earns replies without hype.  
**Time:** 20–30 min  
**Deliverable:** Outbound Message Pack

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **produce a usable Outbound Message Pack and run a first sanity check**.

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] Outbound Message Pack exists and is saved
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] You can explain the key idea in one minute

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** Outbound Message Pack
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Outbound messaging for European B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Outbound Message Pack is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

## Guided exercise (10–15 min)

### Inputs
- A blank doc or sheet
- Your target market or sport category

### Steps

1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Outbound Message Pack**.

**One-liner:** Create proof assets that are quote-safe and procurement-friendly.  
**Time:** 20–30 min  
**Deliverable:** Case Study Template

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **produce a usable Case Study Template and run a first sanity check**.

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] Case Study Template exists and is saved
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] You can explain the key idea in one minute

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** Case Study Template
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Case studies and proof for European B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Case Study Template is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.
