Step 1: list every party who touches the deal from first contact to delivery. Step 2: assign each party a role label (payer, economic buyer, champion, user, technical evaluator, procurement, legal, finance). Step 3: write one sentence per role stating what they fear and what they want. Step 4: identify the single role that can stop the deal late and write the prevention action.\n\n## Deliverable\n\nOne-page stakeholder matrix: columns = role, name or function, decision power (0 to 3), success metric, risk, required proof. Include a single paragraph: your primary champion plan and your primary blocker plan.\n\n## Sources\n\n*   [https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale](https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale)\n*   [https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales](https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales)",

For each: write the job-to-be-done, 3 measurable outcomes, 5 fit signals, 5 disqualifiers, and the first proof you would show. Then write a short 'non-ICP' list: who you will not sell to and why.\n\n## Deliverable\n\nICP pack (6 sheets) with a single scoring rule: Fit Score = (signals met) minus (disqualifiers triggered). Include a 'walk-away' rule that triggers disqualification.\n\n## Sources\n\n*   [https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process](https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process)\n*   [https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology](https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology)",
