Include a 'walk-away' rule that triggers disqualification. is completed\n- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks\n- [ ] Next step, owner, and date are defined\n\n### Output you will produce\n\n- **Deliverable:** ICP pack (6 sheets) with a single scoring rule: Fit Score = (signals met) minus (disqualifiers triggered). Include a 'walk-away' rule that triggers disqualification.\n- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets\n- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes\n\n## Who\n\n**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  \n**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)\n\n## What\n\n### What it is\nOffer positioning and category for U.S. B2B sport sales.\n\n### What it is not\nA long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Positioning One-Pager is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Create 6 ICP sheets (2 per motion).\n2. For each: write the job-to-be-done, 3 measurable outcomes, 5 fit signals, 5 disqualifiers, and the first proof you would show.\n3. Then write a short 'non-ICP' list: who you will not sell to and why.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Positioning One-Pager |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **ICP pack (6 sheets) with a single scoring rule: Fit Score = (signals met) minus (disqualifiers triggered).

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Lead Source Plan + First 50 Accounts is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Build a packaging table with 3 B2B tiers, 2 B2C entry tiers, and 1 public-sector compliant bundle.\n2. For each package: list inclusions, exclusions, delivery responsibilities, SLA, success criteria, and an explicit upgrade path.\n3. Then write one paragraph: how pricing changes with scale.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Lead Source Plan + First 50 Accounts |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Packaging table plus inclusion rules. Include a 'pilot contract' skeleton section list: scope, success criteria, timeline, data handling, brand safety, reporting, exit clause.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale\n4. **https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales\n5. **The End of Solution Sales** — HBR.\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2012/07/the-end-of-solution-sales\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Pricing Strategy**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/topic/pricing-strategy\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Account Research Pack (Top 10) is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Create one proof pack per motion.\n2. For each: write a measurable outcome statement with a baseline and a time window, define the data required to measure it, and list acceptable evidence types (screenshots, logs, third-party reports, invoices).\n3. Build a one-page case study outline.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Account Research Pack (Top 10) |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Proof pack outline: 3 case study shells + measurement plan.

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Discovery Script + Question Bank is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Design a 4-channel plan (choose from inbound, outbound, paid, community, marketplace, referral).\n2. For each channel: define weekly activities, the quality gate (what qualifies a lead), and the handoff rule into pipeline.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Discovery Script + Question Bank |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Channel plan plus a weekly scoreboard: activity counts, qualified leads, meetings, opportunities created, conversion rate.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/\n4. **https://meddicc.com/resources/meddicc-versus-other-qualification-frameworks-like-bant** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://meddicc.com/resources/meddicc-versus-other-qualification-frameworks-like-bant\n5. **Pipeline Management** — Salesforce.\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **B2B Digital Selling**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2020/03/selling-in-a-crisis\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Proposal Template v1 is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Build a simple model for B2C, B2B, B2G: CAC, conversion rates, retention/churn, gross margin, payback.\n2. Add an assumptions register and mark which assumptions are unproven.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Proposal Template v1 |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Unit economics sheet plus assumptions register and a 'kill criteria' list (what would make you stop a motion).**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process\n4. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/\n5. **MEDDPICC Sales Methodology** — MEDDICC.\n   Read: https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Unit Economics 101**\n   Read: https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-unit-economics\n",

      "content": "# Lesson 13: Discovery that drives value and urgency\n\n**One-liner:** Run discovery that quantifies impact, maps stakeholders, and produces a mutual plan.\n**Time:** 20–30 min  \n**Deliverable:** Discovery script plus note template that captures: pain, baseline, desired outcome, stakeholders, decision steps, next step.\n\n## Learning goal\n\nYou will be able to: **Run discovery that quantifies impact, maps stakeholders, and produces a mutual plan.**\n\n### Success criteria (observable)\n\n- [ ] Discovery script plus note template that captures: pain, baseline, desired outcome, stakeholders, decision steps, next step. is completed\n- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks\n- [ ] Next step, owner, and date are defined\n\n### Output you will produce\n\n- **Deliverable:** Discovery script plus note template that captures: pain, baseline, desired outcome, stakeholders, decision steps, next step.\n- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets\n- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes\n\n## Who\n\n**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  \n**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)\n\n## What\n\n### What it is\nProcurement process for U.S. B2B sport sales.\n\n### What it is not\nA long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Procurement Checklist is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Write a discovery script with: situation, problem, implication, need-payoff questions.\n2. Add a short section to confirm decision process and procurement steps.\n3. Then create a mutual action plan draft.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Procurement Checklist |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Discovery script plus note template that captures: pain, baseline, desired outcome, stakeholders, decision steps, next step.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n4. **https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/blog/spin-selling-questions** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/blog/spin-selling-questions\n5. **SPIN Methodology Overview** — Huthwaite.\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Discovery Questions That Create Value**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-b2b-sellers-guide-to-discovery\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Stakeholder Update Email Set is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Pick 2 partner models and justify them using 5 criteria: capability, reach, credibility, conflict risk, and unit economics.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Stakeholder Update Email Set |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Partner model selection memo with a go/no-go checklist.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center\n4. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n5. **Referral Partners** — Salesforce.\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Partner Relationship Management (PRM) Basics**\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Outbound Message Pack is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1.

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Renewal Plan is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Define the handoff from sales to delivery: required fields, success criteria, scope, risks, and owners.\n2. Define partner-sourced opportunity rules for attribution and evidence.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Renewal Plan |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Revenue ops alignment plan plus process map and a handoff checklist.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/\n4. **Sales Pipeline Management** — Salesforce.\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/pipeline/management/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **CRM Data Quality Basics**\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/data-quality/\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Daily Sales System is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Define the top 10 risks and write: trigger, impact, mitigation, escalation owner, and time box.\n2. Include a post-signature risk checklist.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Daily Sales System |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Risk playbook plus escalation map and a post-signature success protection checklist.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale\n4. **https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far\n5. **SPIN Methodology Overview** — Huthwaite.\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Objection Handling Frameworks**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-overcome-your-fear-of-rejection\n",

      "content": "# Lesson 30: Final blueprint and 90-day operating plan\n\n**One-liner:** Synthesize the system into a single operating plan that can be executed, measured, and improved.\n**Time:** 20–30 min  \n**Deliverable:** Complete blueprint plus 90-day operating cadence: weekly agenda, scorecards, review actions, and change log rules.\n\n## Learning goal\n\nYou will be able to: **Synthesize the system into a single operating plan that can be executed, measured, and improved.**\n\n### Success criteria (observable)\n\n- [ ] Complete blueprint plus 90-day operating cadence: weekly agenda, scorecards, review actions, and change log rules. is completed\n- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks\n- [ ] Next step, owner, and date are defined\n\n### Output you will produce\n\n- **Deliverable:** Complete blueprint plus 90-day operating cadence: weekly agenda, scorecards, review actions, and change log rules.\n- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets\n- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes\n\n## Who\n\n**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  \n**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)\n\n## What\n\n### What it is\nCapstone: 90-day execution plan for U.S. B2B sport sales.\n\n### What it is not\nA long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] 90-Day Execution Plan is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Assemble the final blueprint: motions, ICPs, packages, channels, pipeline, partners, procurement readiness, KPIs, and risks.\n2. Produce a 90-day plan with weekly milestones.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | 90-Day Execution Plan |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\n\nRepeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.\n\nUse the same deliverable format: **Complete blueprint plus 90-day operating cadence: weekly agenda, scorecards, review actions, and change log rules.**.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale\n4. **https://sam.gov/opportunities** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://sam.gov/opportunities\n5. **https://ted.europa.eu/en/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://ted.europa.eu/en/\n6. **Making the Consensus Sale** — HBR.\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2015/03/making-the-consensus-sale\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Operating Cadence and Rhythm**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2017/01/why-you-need-a-weekly-review\n",
