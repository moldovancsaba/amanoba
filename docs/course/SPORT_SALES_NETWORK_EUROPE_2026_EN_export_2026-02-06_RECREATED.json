The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Positioning One-Pager is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Positioning One-Pager**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Positioning One-Pager |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process\n4. **https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n5. **SPIN Methodology Overview** — Huthwaite.\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): A Practical Guide**\n   Read: https://www.hubspot.com/sales/ideal-customer-profile\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Buying Committee Map is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Buying Committee Map**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Buying Committee Map |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/csp-overview** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/csp-overview\n4. **https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=experience.networks_leaddist_dealreg.htm&language=en_US&type=5** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=experience.networks_leaddist_dealreg.htm&language=en_US&type=5\n5. **Buying Committees and the B2B Buying Journey** — Gartner (overview).\n   Read: https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Deal Registration (Partner Programs)**\n   Read: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=experience.networks_leaddist_dealreg.htm&language=en_US&type=5\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Procurement Checklist is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Procurement Checklist**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Procurement Checklist |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n4. **https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/blog/spin-selling-questions** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/blog/spin-selling-questions\n5. **SPIN Methodology Overview** — Huthwaite.\n   Read: https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Discovery Questions That Create Value**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-b2b-sellers-guide-to-discovery\n",

      "content": "# Lesson 16: Partner model selection\n\n**One-liner:** Keep multi-stakeholder deals moving with structured updates.  \n**Time:** 20–30 min  \n**Deliverable:** Stakeholder Update Email Set\n\n## Learning goal\n\nYou will be able to: **produce a usable Stakeholder Update Email Set and run a first sanity check**.\n\n### Success criteria (observable)\n\n- [ ] Stakeholder Update Email Set exists and is saved\n- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks\n- [ ] You can explain the key idea in one minute\n\n### Output you will produce\n\n- **Deliverable:** Stakeholder Update Email Set\n- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets\n- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes\n\n## Who\n\n**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in Europe  \n**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)\n\n## What\n\n### What it is\nStakeholder communication for European B2B sport sales.\n\n### What it is not\nA long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Stakeholder Update Email Set is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Stakeholder Update Email Set**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Stakeholder Update Email Set |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center\n4. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n5. **Referral Partners** — Salesforce.\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Partner Relationship Management (PRM) Basics**\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Scope Guardrails is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Scope Guardrails**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Scope Guardrails |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n4. **Referral Partners** — Salesforce.\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/sales/partner-relationship-management/referral-partner/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Event Marketing ROI (B2B)**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-to-measure-marketing-effectiveness\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Market Focus Decision is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Market Focus Decision**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Market Focus Decision |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/european-single-procurement-document-and-ecertis_en** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/european-single-procurement-document-and-ecertis_en\n4. **https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/\n5. **https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/eforms_en** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/eforms_en\n6. **eCertis** — European Commission.\n   Read: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/#/search\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **ESPD (European Single Procurement Document)**\n   Read: https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/public-procurement/digital-procurement/european-single-procurement-document_en\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Event Sales Plan is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Event Sales Plan**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Event Sales Plan |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://sam.gov/entity-registration** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://sam.gov/entity-registration\n4. **https://sam.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/entity-checklist.pdf** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://sam.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/entity-checklist.pdf\n5. **https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-13** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-13\n6. **https://portal.etimad.sa/en-us** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://portal.etimad.sa/en-us\n7. **https://esupply.dubai.gov.ae/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://esupply.dubai.gov.ae/\n8. **https://www.adgpg.gov.ae/** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.adgpg.gov.ae/\n9. **https://www.ashghal.gov.qa/en/Tenders/pages/erptenders.aspx** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.ashghal.gov.qa/en/Tenders/pages/erptenders.aspx\n10. **Etimad (Saudi Government Procurement)** — KSA.\n   Read: https://etimad.sa/\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **SAM.gov (US Federal Contracting)**\n   Read: https://sam.gov/\n",

The goal is a working artifact you can use today.\n\n### 2-minute theory\n\n- European sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.\n- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.\n- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.\n\n### Key terms\n\n- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process\n- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase\n\n## Where\n\n### Applies in\n\n- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands\n- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations\n- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)\n\n### Does not apply in\n\n- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement\n\n### Touchpoints\n\n- Website and proof assets\n- Email and calls\n- Proposal and contract\n- Pilot delivery\n\n## When\n\n### Use it when\n\n- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision\n- You are unsure who owns budget\n- You need to design a pilot\n\n### Frequency\nWeekly during active pipeline building.\n\n### Late signals\n\n- Meetings repeat with no new information\n- No written next step\n- Buyer asks for a proposal too early\n\n## Why it matters\n\n### Practical benefits\n\n- Shorter sales cycles\n- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal\n- Higher win rate through clearer fit\n\n### Risks of ignoring\n\n- Stalled deals\n- Discount pressure\n- Scope creep and delivery failures\n\n### Expectations\n\n- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence\n- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement\n\n## How\n\n### Step-by-step method\n\n1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.\n2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.\n3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).\n4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.\n5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.\n\n### Do and don't\n\n**Do**\n\n- Use concrete language and numbers when you can\n- Write next steps as a calendar action\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof\n- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete\n\n### Common mistakes and fixes\n\n- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints\n- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria\n\n### Done when\n\n- [ ] Case Study Template is saved\n- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date\n- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed\n\n> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.\n\n## Guided exercise (10–15 min)\n\n### Inputs\n- A blank doc or sheet\n- Your target market or sport category\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open a blank doc or sheet named **Case Study Template**.\n2. Fill the table below quickly. Do not overthink.\n3. Write one next-step request you will use this week.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Deliverable name | Case Study Template |\n| Top segment |  |\n| Top 3 stakeholders |  |\n| Decision criteria |  |\n| Next step (owner + date) |  |\n\n## Independent exercise (5–10 min)\n\n### Task\nRepeat the same deliverable for a second segment or a second account type.\n\n### Output\nSame table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.\n\n## Self-check (yes/no)\n\n- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts\n- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date\n- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk\n- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it\n\n### Baseline metric (recommended)\n\n- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)\n- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet\n\n## Bibliography (sources used)\n\n1. **SPIN Selling** — Neil Rackham (book).\n2. **The Challenger Sale** — Matthew Dixon & Brent Adamson (book).\n3. **https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/legal/Agreements/alliance-agreements-and-terms/salesforce-partner-program-policies.pdf** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/legal/Agreements/alliance-agreements-and-terms/salesforce-partner-program-policies.pdf\n4. **https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/csp-overview** — Canonical source (URL).\n   Read: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/csp-overview\n5. **CSP Program Overview** — Microsoft.\n   Read: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/enroll/csp-overview\n\n## Read more (optional)\n\n1. **Sales Compensation (overview)**\n   Read: https://hbr.org/topic/sales-compensation\n",
