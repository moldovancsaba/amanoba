**Time:** 20–30 min  
**Deliverable:** One-page stakeholder matrix: columns = role, name or function, decision power (0 to 3), success metric, risk, required proof. Include a single paragraph: your primary champion plan and your primary blocker plan.

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **Build a buyer-reality map for a sport or fitness offer by identifying payers, economic buyers, technical buyers, champions, users, blockers, and governance functions.**

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] One-page stakeholder matrix: columns = role, name or function, decision power (0 to 3), success metric, risk, required proof. Include a single paragraph: your primary champion plan and your primary blocker plan. is completed
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] Next step, owner, and date are defined

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** One-page stakeholder matrix: columns = role, name or function, decision power (0 to 3), success metric, risk, required proof. Include a single paragraph: your primary champion plan and your primary blocker plan.
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Value chain and stakeholder map for U.S. B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Sport Sales Value Chain Map is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

## Guided exercise (10–15 min)

### Inputs
- A blank doc or sheet
- Your target market or sport category

### Steps

1. Choose one real offer (yours or a known sport-tech/fitness offer).
2. Step 1: list every party who touches the deal from first contact to delivery.
3. Step 2: assign each party a role label (payer, economic buyer, champion, user, technical evaluator, procurement, legal, finance).
4. Step 3: write one sentence per role stating what they fear and what they want.
5. Step 4: identify the single role that can stop the deal late and write the prevention action.

### Output format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Deliverable name | Sport Sales Value Chain Map |
| Top segment |  |
| Top 3 stakeholders |  |
| Decision criteria |  |
| Next step (owner + date) |  |

## Independent exercise (5–10 min)

### Task

Repeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.

### Output
Same table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.

## Self-check (yes/no)

- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts
- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date
- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk
- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it

### Baseline metric (recommended)

- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet

# Lesson 6: Direct vs indirect decision framework

**One-liner:** Decide which segments must be sold direct versus partner-led, based on margin, control, conflict risk, and enablement cost.
**Time:** 20–30 min  
**Deliverable:** Route-to-market decision matrix: account, route, reason, required proof, owner, conflict rule.

## Learning goal

You will be able to: **Decide which segments must be sold direct versus partner-led, based on margin, control, conflict risk, and enablement cost.**

### Success criteria (observable)

- [ ] Route-to-market decision matrix: account, route, reason, required proof, owner, conflict rule. is completed
- [ ] Success criteria are written as yes/no checks
- [ ] Next step, owner, and date are defined

### Output you will produce

- **Deliverable:** Route-to-market decision matrix: account, route, reason, required proof, owner, conflict rule.
- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Buying committee and power for U.S. B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Buying Committee Map is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

## Guided exercise (10–15 min)

### Inputs
- A blank doc or sheet
- Your target market or sport category

### Steps

1. Take 10 target accounts and classify each: direct, partner-led, or co-sell.
2. For each classification, write the reason in one sentence and list the minimum partner capability required (if partner-led).
3. Define a conflict rule for when both direct and partner touch the account.

### Output format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Deliverable name | Buying Committee Map |
| Top segment |  |
| Top 3 stakeholders |  |
| Decision criteria |  |
| Next step (owner + date) |  |

## Self-check (yes/no)

- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts
- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date

**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Sponsorship and partnership packaging for U.S. B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Sponsorship Package Menu is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

- **Format:** 1 table + short bullets
- **Where saved:** your course folder or CRM notes

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Stakeholder communication for U.S. B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Stakeholder Update Email Set is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

## Guided exercise (10–15 min)

### Inputs
- A blank doc or sheet
- Your target market or sport category

### Steps

1. Pick 2 partner models and justify them using 5 criteria: capability, reach, credibility, conflict risk, and unit economics.

Use the same deliverable format: **Partner model selection memo with a go/no-go checklist.**.

### Output
Same table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.

## Self-check (yes/no)

- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts
- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date
- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk
- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Weekly Forecast Sheet is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.

## Guided exercise (10–15 min)

### Inputs
- A blank doc or sheet
- Your target market or sport category

### Steps

1. Create a federal readiness checklist: registrations, standard declarations, past performance evidence, and internal owners.
2. Then create a discovery outreach script that respects procurement boundaries.

### Output format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Deliverable name | Weekly Forecast Sheet |
| Top segment |  |
| Top 3 stakeholders |  |
| Decision criteria |  |
| Next step (owner + date) |  |

## Independent exercise (5–10 min)

### Task

Repeat the guided exercise for a different U.S. target account or partner.

Use the same deliverable format: **Federal readiness checklist plus outreach script and a standard evidence pack index.**.

### Output
Same table format. Add 3 notes about what changed.

## Self-check (yes/no)

- [ ] I can name the decision owner role for my target accounts
- [ ] I wrote a next step with owner and date
- [ ] I can explain why this deliverable reduces deal risk
- [ ] I saved the deliverable where my team can find it

### Baseline metric (recommended)

- **Baseline metric:** number of target accounts mapped today (target: 5)
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Tool used:** your CRM or a spreadsheet

## Who

**Primary persona:** Sales lead or founder selling B2B sport or fitness solutions in USA  
**Secondary persona(s):** Commercial lead, marketing, delivery/ops, and a technical contact (if relevant)

## What

### What it is
Upsell and expansion for U.S. B2B sport sales.

### What it is not
A long document. The goal is a working artifact you can use today.

### 2-minute theory

- U.S. sport sales often involve multiple stakeholders and formal processes.
- Speed comes from clarity: roles, process, and a next step with an owner and date.
- Your job is to reduce risk for the buyer and effort for the committee.

### Key terms

- **ICP:** Ideal Customer Profile, defined by problem, budget, and buying process
- **Buying committee:** The group that influences or approves the purchase

## Where

### Applies in

- Selling to clubs, leagues, federations, venues, academies, and sport brands
- Selling to agencies that deliver sport activations
- Selling to fitness chains and local operators (if your offer fits)

### Does not apply in

- One-off consumer sales (B2C) without committees or procurement

### Touchpoints

- Website and proof assets
- Email and calls
- Proposal and contract
- Pilot delivery

## When

### Use it when

- A deal has many 'yes' signals but no decision
- You are unsure who owns budget
- You need to design a pilot

### Frequency
Weekly during active pipeline building.

### Late signals

- Meetings repeat with no new information
- No written next step
- Buyer asks for a proposal too early

## Why it matters

### Practical benefits

- Shorter sales cycles
- Fewer surprises in procurement/legal
- Higher win rate through clearer fit

### Risks of ignoring

- Stalled deals
- Discount pressure
- Scope creep and delivery failures

### Expectations

- Improves: decision clarity and buyer confidence
- Does not guarantee: immediate revenue or fast procurement

## How

### Step-by-step method

1. Define the target account type and what a 'good deal' looks like.
2. List the roles involved and the most likely decision owner.
3. Write 3 decision criteria the buyer will use (cost, risk, impact).
4. Create a simple table that captures your findings.
5. Write the next step you will ask for, with date and owner.

### Do and don't

**Do**

- Use concrete language and numbers when you can
- Write next steps as a calendar action

**Don't**

- Do not rely on verbal enthusiasm as proof
- Do not send a proposal before discovery is complete

### Common mistakes and fixes

- **Too broad ICP:** Narrow by problem + buyer type + delivery constraints
- **No next step:** End every interaction with owner + date + exit criteria

### Done when

- [ ] Expansion Map is saved
- [ ] Next step is written with owner + date
- [ ] Top stakeholder roles are listed

> **Pro tip:** Keep everything short enough to update in 5 minutes.
