- ✅ **Test immediately** after each change

#### 3. Documentation Requirements
- ✅ **Document every step** in feature document
- ✅ **Update handover document** as work progresses
- ✅ **No placeholders** - all docs must reflect current state
- ✅ **Document failures** and learnings

#### 4. Build & Test Checklist
Before committing ANY change:

## Recommended Delivery Order

### Priority 1: Admin Certificate Management (High Value)
**Estimated**: 2-3 days

1. **Admin Certificate List API** (1 day)
   - Create `app/api/admin/certificates/route.ts`
   - GET endpoint with search, filter, pagination
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Admin Certificate List Page** (1-2 days)
   - Create `app/[locale]/admin/certificates/page.tsx`
   - List all certificates
   - Search and filter UI
   - View details, revoke functionality

**Why First**: Enables admin management of certificates, critical for operations.

---

### Priority 2: Certificate Verification with Slug (Security)
**Estimated**: 1-2 days

1. **Verification API with Slug** (0.5 day)
   - Create/update `app/api/certificates/[slug]/route.ts`
   - GET: Public verification with privacy checks
   - PATCH: Toggle public/private (owner only)

2. **Verification Page with Slug** (0.5-1 day)
   - Create `app/[locale]/certificate/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - Public verification page
   - Privacy controls for owner

**Why Second**: Improves security and sharing experience.

---

### Priority 3: Profile Certificates Tab (UX Improvement)
**Estimated**: 0.5-1 day

1. **Add Certificates Tab** (0.5 day)
   - Update `app/[locale]/profile/[playerId]/page.tsx`
   - Add 'certificates' to activeTab type
   - Create certificates tab content
   - **CRITICAL**: Ensure type consistency (previous failure point)

**Why Third**: Improves user experience, but current Overview section works.

---

### Priority 4: Analytics & Advanced Features (Nice to Have)
**Estimated**: 2-3 days

1. **Analytics API and Page** (1-2 days)
2. **PDF Generation** (1 day)
3. **Social Media Integration** (0.5 day)

**Why Last**: Lower priority, can be done incrementally.

---

## Critical Learnings & Failure Prevention

### Previous Failures Documented

1. **Type Mismatch in Profile Page** (Error 10)
   - **Issue**: `isOwnProfile` used in `useEffect` dependency before definition
   - **Fix**: Move `isOwnProfile` calculation before dependent `useEffect`
   - **Prevention**: Always define variables before using in dependencies

2. **Certificate Integration Type Mismatch** (Latest Rollback)
   - **Issue**: Added `certificates` to type but not all usages
   - **Fix**: Ensure complete type consistency
   - **Prevention**: Update ALL type usages when changing types

3. **ImageResponse Route Syntax Error** (Build Failure)
   - **Issue**: JSX syntax error in `.tsx` file
   - **Fix**: Ensure proper JSX syntax, file extension `.tsx`
   - **Prevention**: Always test build after creating ImageResponse routes

### Prevention Checklist

Before modifying existing files:
- [ ] **Type Consistency**: Update ALL type definitions and usages
- [ ] **Array Consistency**: If adding to array, update ALL type assertions
- [ ] **Test Immediately**: Build and test right after modification
- [ ] **Consider Isolation**: Can this be a new component instead?
- [ ] **Verify No Partial Updates**: Don't update type without updating usages
- [ ] **Function Hoisting**: Define functions before using in useEffect dependencies
- [ ] **Build Test**: Always run `npm run build` before committing

## Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Next Steps (If Resuming)

1. **Verify Current State**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Should pass
   read_lints     # Should pass
   ```

2. **Choose Next Feature**
   - Recommended: Admin Certificate List (Priority 1)
   - Or: Certificate Verification with Slug (Priority 2)

3. **Create Delivery Plan**
   - Document feature in detail

---

## Delivery Standards

### Code Standards
- Follow existing API route patterns
- Use `requireAdmin()` for admin routes
- Use `connectDB()` at start of API routes
- Use `logger` for errors (not console.log)
- Always use try/catch
- Always return structured JSON responses

### Testing Standards
- Build must pass (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Linter must pass (0 errors)
- Manual testing required
- No breaking changes

### Documentation Standards
- Update feature document as work progresses
- Update handover document after completion
- Document all failures and learnings
- No placeholders in documentation

---

## Risk Areas

### High Risk Areas (Require Extra Caution)

1. **Profile Page Modifications**
   - Previous failures: Type mismatches, hoisting issues
   - **Prevention**: Test type consistency, define variables before use

2. **ImageResponse Routes**
   - Previous failures: JSX syntax errors, file extension issues
   - **Prevention**: Always use `.tsx` extension, test build immediately

3. **Existing File Modifications**
   - Previous failures: Breaking existing functionality
   - **Prevention**: Prefer new files, minimal modifications, test thoroughly

---
