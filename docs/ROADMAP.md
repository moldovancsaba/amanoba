# Amanoba Roadmap — Future Vision & Client Benefits

**Version**: 2.9.33  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-28

This document describes **what we want to build in the future** and **what benefits we want to give to clients**. It is not a task list. **Rules:** Do not list anything that is already delivered (see **RELEASE_NOTES.md**). Do not list anything that has been turned into tasks (see **TASKLIST.md**). Only future vision that is not yet broken down into tasks belongs here. **Only related items:** Only content that belongs in the ROADMAP may appear here — no delivered items, no task-list items, no unrelated content.

## Vision

**Amanoba** is a **unified 30-day learning platform** that combines:

- **Structured learning**: 30-day courses with daily lessons delivered via email
- **Gamified assessment**: Games (QUIZZZ, WHACKPOP, Madoku) as interactive surveys and assessments
- **Retained systems**: Login, rewards, achievements, leaderboards, and gamification
- **Course builder**: Admin interface to create and manage courses

### Core principles

1. **Games as assessments** — Existing games become student assessment tools
2. **Email-first learning** — Daily lessons via email with in-platform access
3. **Gamification intact** — All rewards, points, XP, achievements, and streaks remain
4. **30-day structure** — Each course is a 30-step journey (one lesson per day)
5. **Modular course system** — Build courses using the same flexible architecture as games

## Future Functions We Want to Implement

_(Nothing delivered or already on TASKLIST appears here. Delivered work: RELEASE_NOTES.md. Current tasks: TASKLIST.md. Certificate tooling — pass rules, template A/B — is delivered; see RELEASE_NOTES.)_

### Future quarters (Q2–Q4 2026 and beyond)

**What we want:**

- **Multiple courses**: Enrolment in several courses at once; prerequisites
- **Live sessions**: Scheduled live lessons with instructors
- **AI-powered personalisation**: Adaptive difficulty and recommendations from assessments
- **Instructor dashboard**: Instructors create and manage their own courses
- **Mobile app**: Native app and offline access
- **Video lessons**: Video in lessons; in-lesson quizzes

**Client benefits:**

- Learners get more flexibility, support, and variety
- Admins and instructors can scale and differentiate offerings

## Client Benefits Summary (future only)

| Who            | Benefits we want to deliver (not yet delivered or on TASKLIST) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learners**   | Mobile and offline; live features |
| **Admins**     | Certificate tooling |
| **Business**   | Higher engagement, completion, and retention; clearer product direction; scalable course and content creation |

---

## Success Metrics (Future Tracking)

- **Learning**: Course enrolment rate; lesson and course completion rate; email open rate; assessment engagement; daily active learners
- **Retention**: D7/D30 retention; course abandonment rate
- **Engagement**: Average lessons completed; assessment participation; points and achievements from courses

---

## Principles (How We Build)

- **Similar to game builder**: Same architectural patterns for courses
- **Email-first**: Lessons via email; all content also in platform; timezone-aware; catch-up support
- **Gamification retained**: Course activities award points and achievements; streaks and leaderboards stay
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing games and gamification keep working; courses are opt-in
