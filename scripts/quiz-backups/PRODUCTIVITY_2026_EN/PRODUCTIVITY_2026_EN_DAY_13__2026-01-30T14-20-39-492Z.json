        "They may move fast but create costly rework; the rule must be paired with decision categories and risk checks for large decisions.",
        "They will automatically make perfect decisions because speed guarantees accuracy under uncertainty.",
        "They will eliminate decision fatigue entirely, so risk management becomes unnecessary.",
        "They will never need stakeholder input again because iteration replaces alignment on outcomes."
