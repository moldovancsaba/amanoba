      "question": "A system takes time to design. Why is it still higher leverage than “trying harder” as a habit strategy?",
      "options": [
        "Because a good system reduces decision load and makes correct behavior the default, producing consistent outcomes over time.",
        "Because system design eliminates the need for review and improvement once written down.",
        "Because systems only work when motivation is high, so they are equivalent to habits in practice.",
        "Because habits are always harmful and should never be used for any personal change."

        "Tell everyone to “remember to review weekly” and hope it becomes part of the culture naturally.",
        "Wait until the team feels motivated and then do reviews only when energy is high.",
        "Make weekly review optional with no shared metrics so everyone can interpret progress differently."
