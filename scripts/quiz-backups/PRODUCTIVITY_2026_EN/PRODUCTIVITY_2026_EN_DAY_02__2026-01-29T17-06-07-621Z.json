        "Put the hardest creative work in 3–5 PM because difficulty builds character regardless of outcomes.",
        "Schedule random work whenever it appears, because energy patterns are not predictable or usable.",

      "options": [
        "You will compensate with longer hours, but outcome quality drops and burnout risk rises because constraints are mismanaged.",
        "You will always outperform peak-hour work, because difficulty increases creativity and accuracy automatically.",
        "You will remove the need for breaks, because low energy is solved by more caffeine and willpower.",
        "You will make faster decisions, because fatigue reduces thinking and therefore reduces time spent."
