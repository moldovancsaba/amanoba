        "To track who is working the hardest by counting messages and visible activity.",
        "To replace weekly review, because daily planning makes reflection unnecessary."

        "Outcomes accelerate automatically because daily meetings always produce completed work.",
        "Deep work time increases because huddles reduce interruptions by default.",
        "Carryover becomes irrelevant because talking about tasks completes them."
