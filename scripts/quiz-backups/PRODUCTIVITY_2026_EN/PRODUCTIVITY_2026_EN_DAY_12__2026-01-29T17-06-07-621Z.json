        "Because it increases activity volume automatically; accountability is the same as doing more tasks.",
        "Because it eliminates the need for weekly review; once accountable, reflection is unnecessary.",

        "People stop working completely, because activity-based tracking removes all motivation instantly.",
        "Deep work blocks become longer automatically because more activity means more focus time by default.",
