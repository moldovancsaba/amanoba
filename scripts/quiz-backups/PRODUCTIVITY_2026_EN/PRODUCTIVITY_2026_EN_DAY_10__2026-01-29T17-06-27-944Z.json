        "Work continuously without breaks to build stamina; recovery reduces productivity and should be avoided.",

        "Increase workload to build resilience; fatigue is a sign you should push harder.",
        "Ignore signals; energy is irrelevant as long as you are still doing many tasks.",

      "question": "Why does energy management improve productivity under the outcome/constraints definition, even if total hours stay the same?",
      "options": [
        "Because higher energy increases the quality and speed of outcomes per hour, so the same time yields more meaningful results.",
        "Because energy is unrelated to attention and decision quality, so it cannot change outcomes.",
        "Because energy management is mainly about comfort, which reduces ambition and therefore reduces outcomes.",
        "Because energy management increases activity volume automatically, so it improves productivity by definition."

      "question": "If a team rewards only long hours (not outcomes), what is the likely impact on sustainable productivity?",
      "options": [
        "Burnout risk rises, decision quality drops, and outcomes per constraint decline because recovery is punished instead of designed.",
        "Outcomes improve automatically because long hours guarantee high-quality work regardless of fatigue.",
        "Focus blocks increase because tired brains always concentrate better to compensate.",
        "Carryover disappears because long hours eliminate planning errors without changing systems."
