Not every piece matters equally; learn to spot the hinge.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Treating all parts as equally important.</li>\n<li>Working on what is easy instead of what matters most.</li>\n<li>Confusing activity at the leverage point with busywork elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>For your decomposed problem, name the single highest-leverage component. Commit one concrete move on that component this week.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
