Update the plan and the next move; do not hide the pivot. Changing direction is strength.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Treating pivot as failure.</li>\n<li>Sticking to the plan when it is clearly wrong.</li>\n<li>Pivoting without learning (same mistake in new direction).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>If you have evidence that one plan is wrong, state it in one sentence. Propose the pivot and the new next move. Share with one stakeholder.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
