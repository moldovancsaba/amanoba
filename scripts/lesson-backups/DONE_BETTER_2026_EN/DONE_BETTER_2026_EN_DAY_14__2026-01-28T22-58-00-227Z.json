You will stop drifting.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning goal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use criteria and boundaries to decide.</li>\n<li>Make the decision explicit (what we chose and why).</li>\n<li>Avoid drift: defaulting without choosing.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implicit decisions cause misalignment.</li>\n<li>Explicit choices create accountability.</li>\n<li>Decision is a skill you can practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Key idea</h2>\n<p>Decision as skill means choosing with intent using criteria and boundaries, not drift. Make the decision explicit: what we chose and why. You stop drifting when you practice it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Delaying decision by asking for more data indefinitely.</li>\n<li>Implicit decisions that no one wrote down.</li>\n<li>Confusing consensus with a clear decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>Make one decision today that you would have left vague. Write it down: what we chose, why, and what we are not doing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
