It is your map.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning goal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>List unknowns explicitly.</li>\n<li>Use unknowns to guide inquiry and next steps.</li>\n<li>Reduce the cost of not knowing by naming it.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hidden unknowns cause surprises and rework.</li>\n<li>Naming unknowns turns them into a checklist.</li>\n<li>Saying \"I don't know yet\" is leadership.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Key idea</h2>\n<p>Unknowns are what you do not yet know. Treat them as assets: they tell you what to learn or validate next. Communicate them so others can align.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hiding or avoiding unknowns.</li>\n<li>Treating not knowing as failure.</li>\n<li>Making decisions as if unknowns do not exist.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>For one current project, write a short \"unknowns list\": what you do not know yet and when or how you will find out. Share it with one stakeholder.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
