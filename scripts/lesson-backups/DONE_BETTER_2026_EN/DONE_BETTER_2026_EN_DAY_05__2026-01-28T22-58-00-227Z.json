If you cannot explain it to someone else in 30 seconds, simplify again. The restatement is the problem you will solve.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Procedure</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Write the problem as given.</li>\n<li>Rewrite it in your own words (no jargon).</li>\n<li>Ask: what would solving this look like?</li>\n<li>If you cannot explain it in 30 seconds, simplify again.</li>\n<li>Lock the restatement as the working problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Using jargon or someone else's wording without internalizing.</li>\n<li>Keeping the problem fuzzy.</li>\n<li>Skipping restatement and going straight to solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>Take the problem from Day 2. Rewrite it in three sentences or less so a colleague could understand it without context. Use that as your working problem.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
