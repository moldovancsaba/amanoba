Three plans is control.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning goal</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate at least three different paths to the goal.</li>\n<li>Assess risk and cost for each.</li>\n<li>Choose one to execute; keep a backup.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Single plan = single point of failure.</li>\n<li>Alternatives reduce anxiety and increase options.</li>\n<li>Revisiting plans when evidence changes is control.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Key idea</h2>\n<p>Multiple paths means having more than one plan so that failure of one does not mean failure of the goal. One plan is hope; three plans is control.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Procedure</h2>\n<ol><li>Define the goal.</li><li>List at least three different ways to get there.</li><li>For each: main risk and cost.</li><li>Choose one to execute first; keep one as backup; park the third.</li><li>Revisit when you have new evidence.</li></ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Betting everything on one plan.</li>\n<li>Treating backup plans as lack of commitment.</li>\n<li>Never revisiting plans when evidence changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>For one important goal, list 3 different paths. Pick one to run first and one as backup. Write down the trigger that would make you switch.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
