Transparency turns transactions into alliances. Invite clients into the problem, not just the deliverable.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hiding problems to preserve the relationship short-term.</li>\n<li>Treating the client as someone to please rather than to align with.</li>\n<li>No clear communication cadence.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>With one client or partner, share one constraint or trade-off you have not mentioned before. Propose how you will handle it together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
