Refuse vague done. Use testability to scope the next move and to know when to stop.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Common mistakes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accepting done without a clear test.</li>\n<li>Moving on before the test is run.</li>\n<li>Defining tests that are too expensive to run.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Today's move</h2>\n<p>For your current next move, write the test: \"We are done when [observable condition].\" If you cannot write it, the move is too vague; narrow it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can explain the key idea in one sentence.</li>\n<li>You have one concrete move to do today.</li>\n</ul>",
