  "content": "<h1>How AI reshapes the buying journey</h1>\n<p><em>Today you'll understand how the journey changed from \"search list\" to \"answer + recommendation\" and what it means for your store.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What you'll learn today</h2>\n<p>Today you'll achieve these two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll map today's journey and AI touchpoints, so you understand where customers interact with AI.</li>\n<li>You'll create 5 AI touchpoints for your store that you can optimize right away.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why this matters to you</h2>\n<p>AI answers often precede the classic list; missing means lost attention. Short answers magnify wrong price/stock/policy. Understanding the new journey helps you optimize for where customers actually interact with AI.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Old vs new buying journey: what changed?</h2>\n<h3>Old journey</h3>\n<p>The traditional buying journey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search → list → click</li>\n<li>User browses search results</li>\n<li>User clicks on a result</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New journey</h3>\n<p>The AI-powered buying journey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Question → AI summary + recommendation → click/chat continue</li>\n<li>User asks a question</li>\n<li>AI provides summary and recommendation</li>\n<li>User clicks or continues chatting</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impact on Shopify</h3>\n<p>This means you need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An answer capsule at the top (who it's for, pros/cons, price/stock, policy)</li>\n<li>Clear, quotable information</li>\n<li>Users arrive \"later\" with clearer intent</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Examples: what works, what doesn't?</h2>\n<h3>✅ Good AI-ready product page</h3>\n<p>Top capsule: who for, who not, price/stock, shipping link, clear structure.</p>\n<h3>❌ Poor AI-ready product page</h3>\n<p>Long unstructured copy, missing policy links, no answer capsule.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practice: map your AI touchpoints (10-15 min)</h2>\n<p>Now you'll map today's journey and create AI touchpoints for your store. Here are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Map today's customer journey: where do customers interact with AI?</li>\n<li>Create 5 AI touchpoints for your store:\n   <ul>\n   <li>Product discovery</li>\n   <li>Product comparison</li>\n   <li>Policy questions</li>\n   <li>Price/stock inquiries</li>\n   <li>Recommendation requests</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Independent practice: optimize one touchpoint (5-10 min)</h2>\n<p>Now optimize one AI touchpoint on your store (e.g., add an answer capsule to a product page).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<p>Before moving on, check that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Journey mapped with AI touchpoints</li>\n<li>✅ 5 AI touchpoints created for your store</li>\n<li>✅ One touchpoint optimized</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>If you want to go deeper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Search Central – GenAI content: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/using-gen-ai-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/using-gen-ai-content</a></li>\n<li>Shopify product data: <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects/product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects/product</a></li>\n</ul>",
