  "content": "<h1>Why feeds matter: \"offer truth\"</h1>\n<p><em>Today you'll ensure feed and PDP match on price, stock, shipping, returns, identifiers.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What you'll learn today</h2>\n<p>Today you'll achieve these two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll list the offer truth elements (price, stock, shipping, returns, IDs).</li>\n<li>You'll check feed vs PDP gaps on 5 products to find discrepancies.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why this matters to you</h2>\n<p>AI and merchant programs rely on both feed and PDP. Conflicting price/stock/policy → exclusion or bad recommendations. Ensuring consistency helps AI accurately quote your products.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Offer truth: what must match</h2>\n<p>These elements must match between feed and PDP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> – accurate, discounts handled correctly</li>\n<li><strong>Stock</strong> – current, variant-level accuracy</li>\n<li><strong>Shipping/returns</strong> – clear, linked policies</li>\n<li><strong>IDs</strong> – consistent (GTIN/SKU/brand)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Examples: what works, what doesn't?</h2>\n<h3>✅ Good offer truth</h3>\n<p>Feed and PDP show same price/stock/policy, consistent IDs, matching information.</p>\n<h3>❌ Poor offer truth</h3>\n<p>Mismatched price, missing policy, no IDs, conflicting information.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practice: check feed vs PDP (10-15 min)</h2>\n<p>Now you'll compare feed and PDP for 5 products. Here are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick 5 products: compare feed export vs PDP for price/stock/policy.</li>\n<li>Note discrepancies and fixes needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Independent practice: fix one discrepancy (5-10 min)</h2>\n<p>Now fix one discrepancy you found (e.g., update feed price to match PDP).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<p>Before moving on, check that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ 5 products compared</li>\n<li>✅ Discrepancies noted</li>\n<li>✅ At least one fix applied</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>If you want to go deeper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Merchant Center feed requirements: <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112</a></li>\n<li>Shopify feed optimization: <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export</a></li>\n</ul>",
