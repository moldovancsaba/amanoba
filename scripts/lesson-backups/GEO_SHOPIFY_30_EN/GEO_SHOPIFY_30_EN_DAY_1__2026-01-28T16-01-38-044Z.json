  "content": "<h1>What GEO is (and is not) for Shopify</h1>\n<p><em>Today you'll understand how GEO differs from SEO and what \"showing up in AI answers\" really means.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What you'll learn today</h2>\n<p>Today you'll achieve these three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll clearly understand the difference between GEO and SEO.</li>\n<li>You'll know exactly what to expect from GEO: citation, inclusion, and consistency.</li>\n<li>You'll create 5 GEO prompts for your store that you can use right away.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why this matters to you</h2>\n<p>AI answers only list stores if information is easy to fetch and safe to quote. GEO increases your chance of being mentioned, but it doesn't guarantee a sale. Good GEO foundations reduce the risk of appearing in misleading recommendations (wrong price, stock, or shipping information).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>GEO vs SEO: what's the difference?</h2>\n<h3>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h3>\n<p>SEO focuses on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranking in the 10 blue links</li>\n<li>Traditional search results</li>\n<li>Keyword optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)</h3>\n<p>GEO focuses on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appearing and being cited in generative answers</li>\n<li>AI-powered search results</li>\n<li>Data clarity and quotability</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What to expect from GEO</h3>\n<p>When you optimize for GEO, you can expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inclusion</strong>: Does your brand/product show up in AI answers?</li>\n<li><strong>Citation</strong>: Does the answer link to your domain?</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Does it repeat across multiple runs?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Examples: what works, what doesn't?</h2>\n<h3>✅ Good GEO foundation</h3>\n<p>Clear product data (GTIN, price, stock), transparent shipping/returns, clean HTML, stable URLs.</p>\n<h3>❌ Poor GEO foundation</h3>\n<p>Missing identifiers, misleading price, dynamic/duplicate URLs, hidden shipping information.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practice: create your GEO prompts (10-15 min)</h2>\n<p>Now you'll write 5 GEO prompts for your store and clarify what you expect. Here are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write 5 GEO prompts for your store (e.g., \"Best [category] 2025 in [country]\").</li>\n<li>Note what you expect for each: inclusion, citation, consistency.</li>\n<li>Save them in a table with columns: Prompt | Expected outcome | Notes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Independent practice: test your prompts (5-10 min)</h2>\n<p>Now run the 5 prompts in ChatGPT/Copilot/Google AI and note if your store appears and is cited.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<p>Before moving on, check that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ You have 5 prompts written</li>\n<li>✅ You can state GEO vs SEO differences clearly</li>\n<li>✅ You wrote expected outcomes for each prompt</li>\n<li>✅ You ran the first manual test and took notes</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>If you want to go deeper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>arXiv: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization): <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735</a></li>\n<li>Search Engine Land – What is GEO: <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-geo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-geo</a></li>\n</ul>",
