  "content": "<h1>GEO vs SEO on Shopify: what to watch</h1>\n<p><em>Today you'll see which elements matter for generative surfaces and how they complement SEO.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What you'll learn today</h2>\n<p>Today you'll achieve these two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll list what is SEO-first vs GEO-first, so you know what to prioritize.</li>\n<li>You'll build a 10-point GEO checklist for Shopify that you can use right away.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why this matters to you</h2>\n<p>AI answers summarize core product data: if it's missing, you're excluded. GEO is not ranking; it's about clarity and quotability. Understanding the difference helps you focus on what actually matters for AI-powered search.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>SEO-first vs GEO-first: what's the difference?</h2>\n<h3>SEO-first elements</h3>\n<p>These elements matter most for traditional search:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meta title/description – search result snippets</li>\n<li>Internal links – site structure and navigation</li>\n<li>Canonical tags – duplicate content handling</li>\n<li>Page speed – loading performance</li>\n<li>Backlinks – external authority signals</li>\n<li>Long-form structured content – comprehensive articles</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>GEO-first elements</h3>\n<p>These elements matter most for generative AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurate product facts (price, stock, identifiers) plainly rendered</li>\n<li>Verifiable policies (shipping/returns) clearly stated</li>\n<li>Stable URLs that don't change</li>\n<li>Short answer-ready blocks (answer capsule) at the top</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Examples: what works, what doesn't?</h2>\n<h3>✅ Good GEO foundation</h3>\n<p>Top-of-page summary, clear price/stock, GTIN + SKU visible, stable URLs, answer capsule.</p>\n<h3>❌ Poor GEO foundation</h3>\n<p>Long messy copy, missing IDs, mixed variant data, dynamic URLs, no answer capsule.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Practice: build your GEO checklist (10-15 min)</h2>\n<p>Now you'll create a 10-point GEO checklist and apply it to your product pages. Here are the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a 10-point GEO checklist with these items:\n   <ul>\n   <li>Price – clearly displayed</li>\n   <li>Stock – availability status</li>\n   <li>GTIN/SKU – product identifiers</li>\n   <li>Policy – shipping/returns information</li>\n   <li>Answer capsule – short summary at top</li>\n   <li>Stable URL – doesn't change</li>\n   <li>Alt text – image descriptions</li>\n   <li>Structured data – schema markup</li>\n   <li>Internal link – navigation structure</li>\n   <li>Review rules – authentic reviews only</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Apply it to one product page (PDP) and mark what's OK vs missing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Independent practice: audit another page (5-10 min)</h2>\n<p>Now apply the checklist to another PDP and note 3 gaps that need fixing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<p>Before moving on, check that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Checklist done (10 points)</li>\n<li>✅ One PDP audited</li>\n<li>✅ 3 fixes noted on another PDP</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>If you want to go deeper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shopify SEO guide: <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/seo</a></li>\n<li>GEO best practices: <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-geo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-geo</a></li>\n</ul>",
