  "content": "<h1>What Modern B2B Sales Means in 2026</h1>\n<p><em>Sales is decision support and risk reduction, not pitching. You’ll set the mindset for the rest of the course.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Learning Goal</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>State the modern B2B sales goal in one sentence.</li>\n  <li>Spot 3 common myths and the replacement principles.</li>\n  <li>Create a weekly mini-metrics sheet.</li>\n  <li>Start your “Sales Reality Card”.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Wrong mental model = wrong activity = wrong conclusions.</li>\n  <li>Buyers want faster, safer decisions—not a product list.</li>\n  <li>Scale comes from disciplined research, documentation, and next-step control.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<h3>A) What changed for 2026?</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Multi-threaded decisions: business owner, evaluator, finance, procurement, legal, IT/security.</li>\n  <li>Sales must enable decisions, reduce risk, and lead next steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>B) System vs. tactic</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>System</strong>: definitions, minimum fields, predefined steps, weekly measurement.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tactic</strong>: a clever line or trick—can win a deal, but won’t scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>C) 3 common myths & swaps</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>“More activity = more results.”</strong><br/>Swap: better targeting + fast qualification.</li>\n  <li><strong>“We must pitch.”</strong><br/>Swap: discovery + decision-risk handling.</li>\n  <li><strong>“CRM is admin.”</strong><br/>Swap: CRM is the map of reality; without it you can’t see conversion or cycle time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>D) Mental model</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pick the right accounts.</li>\n  <li>Do a fast yes/no qualification.</li>\n  <li>After discovery, commit to a single next step.</li>\n  <li>Keep the pipeline real.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p><strong>Bad (tactic):</strong> “Hi, we grow your revenue—let’s talk 15 minutes.”<br/>Why bad: no ICP signal, no specific problem, no decision-linked next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Good (system):</strong> “Most <em>[industry]</em> teams stall in two spots: weak qualification and fuzzy next steps. In 15 minutes, if we review your stage definitions and top 3 lost reasons, I can tell you where time leaks. Is next Tuesday 10:00 ok?”</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Guided Exercise (10–15 minutes)</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Create your “Sales Reality Card”.</li>\n  <li>Write one sentence: “The goal of B2B sales is to …”.</li>\n  <li>Write the 3 myths and the 3 swaps in your own words.</li>\n  <li>Create a mini-metrics sheet: SQL, discovery, pipeline value, win rate (weekly).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Independent Exercise (5–10 minutes)</h2>\n<p>Pick one closed deal (won/lost) and note: decision risk, where it stalled, what a clearer next step would have been.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Self-check</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>I can state the modern B2B sales goal in one sentence.</li>\n  <li>I can name 3 myths and the swaps.</li>\n  <li>I have a weekly mini-metrics sheet.</li>\n  <li>I captured one lesson from a past deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Optional Deep Dive</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>MEDDPICC: <a href=\"https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://meddicc.com/meddpicc-sales-methodology-and-process</a></li>\n  <li>Gartner B2B buying: <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/insights/sales\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.gartner.com/en/insights/sales</a></li>\n</ul>",
