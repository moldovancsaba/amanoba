## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Merge Strategy: Centralized Reusability Over Brand Silos

**Context**: Merging PlayMass (v4.11.2) and Madoku (v1.5.0) into a unified platform.

**Learning**: Instead of maintaining separate codebases per brand, we established a centralized architecture with:
- Single Next.js App Router application
- Brand configuration stored in MongoDB (`Brand` model)
- Game-specific configs linked via `GameBrandConfig` model
- Shared UI components with brand theming via CSS variables
- Single deployment with runtime brand detection (subdomain or path-based)

**Why It Matters**: This approach prevents code duplication, simplifies maintenance, and enables rapid addition of new brands without forking the codebase.

**Applied In**: ARCHITECTURE.md Section 3, Brand and GameBrandConfig models.

---

### Progressive Disclosure: Gating Premium Features

**Context**: Madoku has premium-only features that need to be accessible only after player engagement.

**Learning**: Implemented progressive disclosure with a clear threshold:
- Free players must complete at least **3 games** before premium features are revealed
- Threshold stored in `GameBrandConfig.premiumGatingConfig.minGamesBeforeShow`
- UI components check `PlayerProgression.totalGamesPlayed` before rendering premium CTAs

**Why It Matters**: Prevents overwhelming new players and increases premium conversion by building habit first.

**Applied In**: Phase 3.5, PlayerProgression model, frontend game launcher logic.

---

### Leaderboard Entries: Always Include Foreign Keys

**Context**: Leaderboards showed empty even after playing games and earning points.

**Root Cause**: Missing `gameId` field in leaderboard entries:
- Leaderboard calculator created entries with `playerId`, `metric`, `period` but **not** `gameId`
- Leaderboard API queried: `{ gameId, period, metric }` expecting entries to have `gameId`
- Result: Query returned 0 results because entries had `null` gameId

**Problem Code**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong: Missing gameId in filter and upsert
const bulkOps = rankings.map((entry, index) => ({
  updateOne: {
    filter: {
      playerId: entry.playerId,
      metric: type,
      period,
      // gameId missing!
    },
    update: { $set: { value: entry.value, rank: index + 1 } },
    upsert: true,
  },
}));
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Include gameId in both filter and $setOnInsert
const bulkOps = rankings.map((entry, index) => ({
  updateOne: {
    filter: {
      playerId: entry.playerId,
      metric: type,
      period,
      ...(gameId && { gameId }), // NEW
    },
    update: {
      $set: {
        value: entry.value,
        rank: index + 1,
        'metadata.lastCalculated': new Date(),
      },
      $setOnInsert: {
        playerId: entry.playerId,
        ...(gameId && { gameId }), // NEW
        metric: type,
        period,
        'metadata.createdAt': new Date(),
      },
    },
    upsert: true,
  },
}));
```

**Learning**: When creating leaderboard or ranking systems:
1. **Always include all foreign keys** (gameId, brandId, etc.) in both filter and insert
2. Use `$setOnInsert` for immutable fields that should only be set on creation
3. Test queries match the exact filter structure used in upserts
4. Verify data exists with proper fields before assuming API logic is broken

**Why It Matters**: Missing foreign keys cause silent failures - queries return empty arrays with no errors, making users think the feature doesn't work.

**Applied In**: 
- `app/lib/gamification/leaderboard-calculator.ts` (lines 49-143)
- `app/lib/gamification/session-manager.ts` (lines 583-599)

---

### Anonymous Login: Seed Data Dependencies

**Context**: Users couldn't log in anonymously despite "Continue Without Registration" button being visible.

**Root Cause**: `GuestUsername` collection was empty:
- Anonymous login calls `getRandomGuestUsername()` which queries `GuestUsername` collection
- When count is 0, function throws error: "No guest usernames available"
- Error was caught but not displayed to user - login silently failed
- No player was created, no session started, no games could be played

**Solution**:
```bash
npm run seed:guest-usernames
```

This populates 104 random 3-word usernames like "London Snake Africa".

**Learning**: For features that depend on seed data:
1. **Check seed data exists** before enabling feature in production
2. **Document seed requirements** in deployment checklist
3. **Show helpful error messages** when seed data is missing (don't fail silently)
4. **Create diagnostic scripts** to verify all required collections have data
5. Consider **auto-seeding** critical data on first deployment

**Prevention**:
- Created diagnostic scripts: `check-guest-usernames.ts`, `check-brand.ts`, `check-player-data.ts`
- These scripts can be run to verify database state before deployment

**Why It Matters**: Missing seed data breaks core user flows with no visible errors, making it impossible to debug without direct database access.

**Applied In**: 
- Anonymous login flow (`app/api/auth/anonymous/route.ts`)
- Guest username utility (`app/lib/utils/anonymous-auth.ts`)
- Seed script (`scripts/seed-guest-usernames.ts`)

---

### Daily Challenge Progress: UTC Timezone Consistency

**Context**: Challenge progress wasn't updating after games were completed, showing 0/2 despite games played.

**Root Cause**: Timezone mismatch between challenge creation and progress tracking:
- Challenge API (`/api/challenges`) correctly uses UTC for date ranges
- Daily challenge tracker used **local timezone** (e.g. `new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate())`)
- Result: Challenges created with UTC dates weren't matched by local date queries

**Problem Code**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong: Uses local timezone
const startOfDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
const endOfDay = new Date(startOfDay);
endOfDay.setDate(endOfDay.getDate() + 1);
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Uses UTC to match challenge creation
const startOfDay = new Date();
startOfDay.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const endOfDay = new Date(startOfDay);
endOfDay.setUTCDate(endOfDay.getUTCDate() + 1);
```

**Learning**: When working with date-based queries across multiple modules:
1. **Choose one timezone** for all date logic (preferably UTC)
2. Document the timezone choice in comments
3. Use `.setUTCHours()` not `.setHours()` for UTC consistency
4. Test with users in different timezones
5. Add logging with `.toISOString()` to verify actual UTC values being compared

**Why It Matters**: Date mismatches silently fail - queries return empty results with no errors, making debugging difficult.

**Applied In**: `app/lib/gamification/daily-challenge-tracker.ts` (lines 71-75), enhanced logging throughout challenge tracking.

---

### Game Completion Flow: Silent Schema Validation Failures

**Context**: All five games (QUIZZZ, SUDOKU, MEMORY, WHACKPOP, MADOKU) were completing but NOT recording statistics, XP, points, daily challenges, or leaderboard rankings. Players reported "playing but nothing updates."

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-18T08:30:00.000Z  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Complete gamification system failure  
**Fixed In**: v2.2.0

**Root Causes Identified**:

#### 1. EventLog Missing Required `metadata.version` Field

**Problem**: 5 EventLog.create() calls in session-manager.ts were missing the **required** `metadata.version` field:
- Game completion event (line 648)
- Points earned event (line 672)
- Level up event (line 692)
- Achievement unlock event (line 712)
- Streak milestone event (line 732)
- Challenge completion event in daily-challenge-tracker.ts (line 349)

**Result**: MongoDB validation silently failed, EventLog records were never created, but transaction continued as if successful. No analytics, no audit trail.

**Problem Code**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong: Missing required metadata.version
await EventLog.create({
  playerId: session.playerId,
  brandId: session.brandId,
  eventType: 'game_played',
  eventData: { /* ... */ },
  timestamp: new Date(),
  metadata: {
    isPremium: player.isPremium, // metadata object exists BUT missing version!
    brandId: session.brandId.toString(),
    pointsEarned: pointsResult.totalPoints,
  },
});
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Include required metadata.version and createdAt
await EventLog.create({
  playerId: session.playerId,
  brandId: session.brandId,
  eventType: 'game_played',
  eventData: { /* ... */ },
  timestamp: new Date(),
  metadata: {
    createdAt: new Date(), // Required
    version: '2.2.0',      // Required
    isPremium: player.isPremium,
    brandId: session.brandId.toString(),
    pointsEarned: pointsResult.totalPoints,
  },
});
```

#### 2. LeaderboardEntry Metric Enum Mismatch

**Problem**: LeaderboardEntry schema enum values did NOT match the metric types used by leaderboard-calculator.ts:

**Schema allowed**:
```typescript
enum: ['score', 'wins', 'points', 'xp', 'streak', 'accuracy']
```

**Code actually used**:
```typescript
'points_balance', 'points_lifetime', 'xp_total', 'level', 'win_streak',
'daily_streak', 'games_won', 'win_rate', 'elo'
```

**Result**: Every leaderboard update silently failed validation. LeaderboardEntry.bulkWrite() succeeded with 0 records written. Leaderboards stayed empty despite games being played.

**Solution**: Updated LeaderboardEntry schema to include ALL actual metric types:
```typescript
metric: {
  type: String,
  enum: {
    values: [
      'score', 'wins', 'points', 'xp', 'streak', 'accuracy', // Legacy
      'points_balance', 'points_lifetime', 'xp_total', 'level', // Current wallet/progression
      'win_streak', 'daily_streak', 'games_won', 'win_rate', 'elo' // Competitive
    ],
  },
},
```

#### 3. EventLog Missing Event Types

**Problem**: EventLog schema enum was missing 'streak_milestone' and 'challenge_completed' event types that were being used in code.

**Solution**: Expanded EventLog.eventType enum to include both missing types.

---

**Key Learnings**:

1. **Schema-Code Alignment is Critical**:
   - When schema enums are defined, code MUST use exactly matching values
   - Schema validation failures are often **silent** - operations succeed but write 0 records
   - Always validate enum additions in both schema AND implementation files

2. **Required Fields Must Always Be Present**:
   - Mongoose schema with `required: [true, 'message']` will fail silently in some contexts
   - Always include ALL required fields, even in nested objects like `metadata`
   - Version tracking should use a constant imported from package.json, not hardcoded strings

3. **Transaction Boundaries Don't Catch Validation Errors**:
   - MongoDB transactions commit successfully even if some operations fail validation
   - Use comprehensive logging AFTER transactions to verify records were created
   - Add debug endpoints to verify expected records exist after operations

4. **Testing Must Include Database Verification**:
   - Don't trust API 200 responses - verify MongoDB records were actually created
   - Check EventLog, LeaderboardEntry, PointsTransaction, PlayerProgression after every game
   - Use MongoDB Compass or database scripts to inspect actual data

5. **Progressive Failure Detection**:
   - Users first notice: "points aren't updating"
   - Then: "leaderboards are empty"
   - Then: "challenges don't progress"
   - **All symptoms trace to same root cause**: schema validation failures

**Prevention Checklist** (to avoid similar issues):

- [ ] When adding new enum values to schemas, grep entire codebase for usages
- [ ] When creating model instances, use TypeScript interfaces to enforce field presence
- [ ] Add post-transaction verification queries in critical flows
- [ ] Enable MongoDB query logging in development to see actual write results
- [ ] Create diagnostic endpoints that verify data integrity: `/api/debug/verify-game-completion`
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage including database state verification
- [ ] Use schema validation error handlers to log failures prominently

**Files Modified**:
- `app/lib/models/leaderboard-entry.ts` (expanded metric enum)
- `app/lib/models/event-log.ts` (expanded eventType enum)
- `app/lib/gamification/session-manager.ts` (added metadata.version to 5 EventLog.create calls)
- `app/lib/gamification/daily-challenge-tracker.ts` (added metadata.version to 1 EventLog.create call)

**Verification Steps** (manual testing checklist):
1. Play QUIZZZ - verify PlayerSession created, points/XP awarded, stats updated
2. Play SUDOKU - verify same
3. Play MEMORY - verify same
4. Play WHACKPOP - verify same
5. Play MADOKU - verify same + ELO rating updated
6. Complete daily challenge - verify progress increments and rewards awarded
7. Check leaderboards - verify entries exist and rankings are accurate
8. Query EventLog - verify all game events are logged with version='2.2.0'
9. Query PointsTransaction - verify audit trail exists for all earnings
10. Check PlayerProgression - verify XP, level, totalGamesPlayed, wins/losses increment

**Impact**: This fix restores the entire gamification loop. Before fix: games playable but meaningless (no progression). After fix: complete engagement loop with points, XP, challenges, leaderboards, achievements.

---

### Question Repetition: Aggressive Cache Busting Required

**Context**: QUIZZZ game showing same 10 questions repeatedly despite 200 questions in database.

**Root Cause**: Browser and Next.js were caching API responses:
- Frontend fetch had no `cache: 'no-store'` directive
- No timestamp parameter to bust URL-based caching
- API responses had no `Cache-Control` headers
- Next.js default behavior caches fetch responses

**Problem Code**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong: Gets cached by browser and Next.js
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/games/quizzz/questions?difficulty=${diff}&count=${count}`
);
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: Triple cache-busting strategy
// 1. Timestamp in URL (browser cache)
const response = await fetch(
  `/api/games/quizzz/questions?difficulty=${diff}&count=${count}&t=${Date.now()}`,
  {
    cache: 'no-store', // 2. Next.js cache directive
  }
);

// 3. Server-side headers in API response
return NextResponse.json(data, {
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  },
});
```

**Learning**: For dynamic game content that must be fresh every time:
1. **URL-based cache busting**: Add `&t=${Date.now()}` to query string
2. **Next.js cache control**: Set `cache: 'no-store'` in fetch options
3. **HTTP cache headers**: Set aggressive `Cache-Control` in API responses
4. **All three are needed** - relying on just one isn't enough

**Why It Matters**: 
- Cached responses completely break content rotation logic
- `showCount` increments in DB but user never sees new questions
- No error messages - silently returns stale data
- Affects user experience dramatically (same questions every game)

**Applied In**: 
- `app/games/quizzz/page.tsx` (lines 120-124, 142-146)
- `app/api/games/quizzz/questions/route.ts` (lines 209-213)
- `app/api/games/quizzz/questions/answers/route.ts` (lines 78-82)

---

## üíæ Backend & Database

### MongoDB Connection Pooling in Next.js

**Context**: Next.js App Router hot-reloads during development, causing multiple MongoDB connection attempts.

**Learning**: Use a global singleton pattern with cached connection:
```typescript
// Prevents "MongoClient already connected" errors
let cached = global.mongoose;
if (!cached) {
  cached = global.mongoose = { conn: null, promise: null };
}
```

**Why It Matters**: Avoids connection exhaustion and development errors.

**Applied In**: `app/lib/mongodb.ts`

---

### Pino Logger Worker Threads in Next.js

**Context**: Pino logger with `pino-pretty` transport was causing "worker thread exited" errors in Next.js development server.

**Problem**: Pino's pretty printing uses worker threads by default, which conflicts with Next.js hot reload and Edge runtime environments, causing:
- "Error: Cannot find module .../worker.js"
- "Error: the worker thread exited"
- 500 errors in API routes during development

**Learning**: For Next.js applications, avoid Pino's transport system entirely:
- Created custom logger wrapper with same interface as Pino
- Uses simple console methods with structured formatting
- Maintains JSON output in production, pretty printing in development
- No worker threads, no async logging complexity
- Supports child loggers for context

```typescript
// Simple logger implementation
const logger = {
  info: (msg: string) => console.log(`[${timestamp}] INFO: ${msg}`),
  error: (msg: string) => console.error(`[${timestamp}] ERROR: ${msg}`),
  child: (context) => createSimpleLogger(context),
};
```

**Why It Matters**: Prevents runtime crashes, enables reliable logging in all Next.js runtime environments (Node.js, Edge, development).

**Applied In**: `app/lib/logger.ts` - Complete rewrite to avoid worker threads while maintaining API compatibility.

---

### Mongoose Schema Design: Strict Validation

**Context**: Preventing data corruption and ensuring type safety in MongoDB.

**Learning**: Always use:
- `strict: true` mode to reject undefined fields
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Mongoose validators for database-level constraints
- Indexes on all frequently queried fields
- TTL indexes for temporary data (e.g., sessions with `expiresAt`)

**Why It Matters**: Catches bugs early, prevents invalid data states, improves query performance.

**Applied In**: All 17 Mongoose models in Phase 2.2.

---

### PlayerProgression Schema: Keep Initialization Code Synchronized

**Context**: Facebook OAuth and anonymous login both create PlayerProgression records for new players.

**Problem**: After updating PlayerProgression schema with additional required fields, the initialization code in `auth.ts` (Facebook OAuth) became outdated, causing "Server Configuration Error" on login:
- Missing `currentXP`, `totalXP` fields
- Old field names (`gamesPlayed` instead of `statistics.totalGamesPlayed`)
- Missing nested structures (`achievements`, `milestones`, `gameSpecificStats`)
- Wrong Streak type values (`'win'` instead of `'WIN_STREAK'`)

**Learning**: When updating Mongoose models with new required fields:
1. Search codebase for all places that create documents of that model
2. Update ALL creation points simultaneously
3. Common places to check:
   - Auth callbacks (`auth.ts` signIn callback)
   - Anonymous login utilities (`anonymous-auth.ts`)
   - Seed scripts
   - API route handlers
4. Use TypeScript interfaces to catch mismatches early
5. Test both auth flows after schema changes

**Why It Matters**: Prevents production login failures, ensures data consistency, catches issues before deployment.

**Applied In**: `auth.ts` (Facebook OAuth signIn callback), `app/lib/utils/anonymous-auth.ts` (guest login).

---

### Event-Sourcing for Analytics

**Context**: Need to track player behavior and system events for analytics without blocking game logic.

**Learning**: Implemented event-sourcing pattern:
- All significant events logged to `EventLog` model
- Fire-and-forget logging (no blocking)
- Daily cron aggregates events into `AnalyticsSnapshot`
- Enables historical analysis without affecting real-time performance

**Why It Matters**: Decouples analytics from core features, enables flexible querying, provides audit trail.

**Applied In**: Phase 6.1, EventLog model, analytics aggregation pipeline.

---

### Game Content Database Migration: Intelligent Selection Algorithm

**Context**: Migrating hardcoded QUIZZZ questions and WHACKPOP emojis to MongoDB to enable dynamic content management and usage tracking.

**Problem Solved**: 
1. **Content Fatigue**: Players seeing same questions repeatedly
2. **No Analytics**: Unable to track which questions are easy/hard
3. **No Scalability**: Can't add content without deploying code
4. **No Adaptive Difficulty**: Same questions for all skill levels

**Learning**: Implemented 3-tier intelligent selection algorithm:
```typescript
// Priority 1: Least shown questions (ensure variety)
showCount ASC
// Priority 2: Harder questions (lower success rate)
correctCount ASC
// Priority 3: Alphabetical (deterministic tiebreaker)
question ASC
```

**Key Decisions**:

1. **Separate Answers API**:
   - Questions API excludes `correctIndex` for security
   - Separate `/answers` endpoint provides correct indexes
   - **Trade-off**: Extra API call vs. preventing client-side cheating
   - **MVP Decision**: Acceptable for current scope, can encrypt later

2. **SessionStorage Caching**:
   - Questions: 5 minute TTL (balance freshness vs. API load)
   - Emojis: 1 hour TTL (rarely change, reduce unnecessary calls)
   - **Why**: Reduce MongoDB queries while maintaining reasonable freshness

3. **Atomic Updates**:
   - `showCount` incremented atomically during question fetch
   - `correctCount` updated via `bulkWrite` after game completion
   - **Why**: Prevents race conditions from concurrent games

4. **Compound Index Design**:
   ```typescript
   { difficulty: 1, isActive: 1, showCount: 1, correctCount: 1, question: 1 }
   ```
   - **Why**: Supports entire query + sort in single index scan
   - **Result**: O(log n) query time regardless of question pool size

**Challenges Faced**:

1. **TypeScript Interface Mismatch**:
   - **Problem**: `Question` interface (no correctIndex) vs. `QuestionWithAnswer` (with correctIndex)
   - **Solution**: Created separate interfaces, fetched answers separately
   - **Lesson**: Design API responses first, then derive TypeScript types

2. **Hardcoded Array Removal**:
   - **Problem**: Stray question literals remaining after comment-only replacement
   - **Solution**: Complete removal of array declarations, not just commenting
   - **Lesson**: Use search tools to verify no hardcoded content remains

3. **Logger Format Errors**:
   - **Problem**: Pino format changed: `logger.error('msg', error)` ‚ùå
   - **Solution**: Correct format: `logger.error({ error }, 'msg')` ‚úÖ
   - **Lesson**: Always check library docs for proper usage patterns

**Performance Insights**:
- **Before**: ~40 questions, all loaded on component mount (~2KB)
- **After**: 120 questions, only 10-15 loaded per game (~1.5KB per fetch)
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache reduces API calls by ~80% during active play
- **Database**: Compound index makes query time consistent at ~10-15ms

**Future-Proofing Enabled**:
- ‚úÖ Admin UI for question management (no code deploy needed)
- ‚úÖ A/B testing different question sets
- ‚úÖ User-submitted questions with moderation workflow
- ‚úÖ Multi-language support (add `language` field)
- ‚úÖ Seasonal/event-based questions (add `availableFrom/Until` fields)
- ‚úÖ Difficulty auto-adjustment based on player performance

**Why It Matters**: This migration transforms static content into a dynamic, data-driven system that enables continuous content improvement without code changes.

**Applied In**: v2.1.0 - QuizQuestion model, WhackPopEmoji model, 4 API endpoints, 2 game components, 2 seed scripts.

---

## üé® Frontend & UI

### Tailwind CSS: Custom Animation Classes

**Context**: Need consistent gamification animations across all UI components.

**Learning**: Defined reusable utility classes in `globals.css`:
- `.animate-points` - points earned visual feedback
- `.animate-achievement` - achievement unlock celebration
- `.animate-level-up` - level up burst effect
- `.animate-streak` - streak maintenance indicator

**Why It Matters**: Ensures consistent visual language, reduces code duplication, easy to update globally.

**Applied In**: `app/globals.css`, all gamification UI components.

---

### Radix UI Primitives: Accessibility by Default

**Context**: Need WCAG AA compliant UI without reinventing the wheel.

**Learning**: Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible primitives (Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, etc.) that:
- Handle keyboard navigation automatically
- Manage focus trapping and screen reader announcements
- Work correctly with Tailwind CSS styling

**Why It Matters**: Saves development time, ensures accessibility compliance, provides robust foundation.

**Applied In**: All modal dialogs, dropdowns, tooltips throughout UI.

---

## üîê Security

### Environment Variable Validation

**Context**: Missing or malformed environment variables cause runtime crashes.

**Learning**: Use Zod schemas to validate all environment variables at startup:
```typescript
const envSchema = z.object({
  MONGODB_URI: z.string().url(),
  ADMIN_PASSWORD: z.string().min(8),
  // ... all required vars
});

const env = envSchema.parse(process.env);
```

**Why It Matters**: Fails fast during deployment, prevents runtime errors in production.

**Applied In**: `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`, startup validation script (Phase 2.1).

---

### Rate Limiting: Per-IP and Per-User

**Context**: Need to prevent abuse of APIs (especially points-earning endpoints).

**Learning**: Implemented dual rate limiting strategy:
- **Per-IP**: 100 requests per 15 minutes (global)
- **Per-User**: 10 game sessions per hour (prevents botting)
- Uses `rate-limiter-flexible` with Redis (production) or in-memory (dev)

**Why It Matters**: Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate high-activity users.

**Applied In**: API route middleware, Phase 10.1 security hardening.

---

## üöÄ DevOps & Process

### Versioning Protocol: Semantic and Strict

**Context**: Need clear version tracking across codebase, database, and documentation.

**Learning**: Enforce strict versioning rules:
- **PATCH** (+0.0.1): Before every `npm run dev`
- **MINOR** (+0.1.0): Before every commit to GitHub
- **MAJOR** (+1.0.0): Only on explicit major release instruction

Version must be synchronized across:
- `package.json`
- All documentation files (README, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- UI footer display
- Database `SystemVersion` model

**Why It Matters**: Ensures traceability, simplifies rollback, prevents version drift.

**Applied In**: Versioning AI Rule (bPbp5By0QzqF3gGu93bVjt), all documentation, versioning scripts.

---

### Documentation: Living and Mandatory

**Context**: Documentation often becomes outdated in fast-paced development.

**Learning**: Make documentation updates **non-negotiable** via AI rules:
- All code changes must be reflected in relevant docs
- TASKLIST.md tracks active work
- RELEASE_NOTES.md logs completed work
- LEARNINGS.md captures insights
- ROADMAP.md shows forward plans only

**Why It Matters**: Maintains project continuity, enables onboarding, prevents knowledge loss.

**Applied In**: Documentation AI Rules (EBsm5NR9tLWo6eFQnCBImg, Ctx324ExgkgcnYH9l9dLq9), Definition of Done.

---

## üéÆ Game Integration

### Unified Session API

**Context**: QUIZZZ, WHACKPOP, and Madoku have different session management approaches.

**Learning**: Created unified session API pattern:
1. Start session: `POST /api/games/{gameId}/session` ‚Üí Returns sessionId
2. Log events: `POST /api/games/{gameId}/session/{sessionId}/events`
3. End session: `POST /api/games/{gameId}/session/{sessionId}/end` ‚Üí Awards points, checks achievements

**Why It Matters**: Standardizes integration, simplifies analytics, enables consistent gamification.

**Applied In**: Phase 4.3, ARCHITECTURE.md Section 5.

---

### Game State: Client vs Server

**Context**: Need to prevent cheating while maintaining smooth gameplay.

**Learning**: Hybrid approach:
- **Client-side**: Real-time game state for responsiveness
- **Server-side**: Validation of final scores using replay verification or heuristics
- **Anti-cheat**: Check score/time ratios, detect impossible achievements

**Why It Matters**: Balances UX and security without over-engineering.

**Applied In**: Game session end API validation logic (Phase 4.3).

---

## üìä Analytics

### Pre-Aggregation vs On-Demand Queries

**Context**: Analytics dashboard needs to be fast even with millions of events.

**Learning**: Use pre-aggregation strategy:
- Daily cron job aggregates `EventLog` into `AnalyticsSnapshot`
- Dashboard queries snapshots (fast) instead of raw events (slow)
- Raw events kept for 90 days for detailed drill-down

**Why It Matters**: Keeps dashboard responsive, reduces database load, enables historical trending.

**Applied In**: Phase 6.2, AnalyticsSnapshot model, daily cron job.

---

## üêõ Debugging & Testing

### Pino Logger: Structured Logging

**Context**: Console.log insufficient for production debugging.

**Learning**: Use Pino structured logger:
- JSON output for machine parsing
- Automatic request ID correlation
- Child loggers for component-specific context
- Log levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal

**Why It Matters**: Enables efficient log analysis, supports monitoring tools, provides audit trail.

**Applied In**: `app/lib/logger.ts`, used throughout API routes and server components.

---

### Manual QA Over Automated Tests

**Context**: MVP Factory model prioritizes speed over test coverage.

**Learning**: For MVP projects:
- Skip unit/integration tests (prohibited by AI rule ksglxIDdoNUOAOmXqrhl9h)
- Focus on manual QA checklists
- Build frequently to catch compilation errors
- Use TypeScript strict mode as first line of defense

**Why It Matters**: Faster iteration, acceptable for MVP with manual oversight.

**Applied In**: Phase 10.3, no test files generated.

---

## üåê Deployment

### Vercel Edge Functions: Limitations

**Context**: Not all code can run on Vercel Edge Runtime.

**Learning**: MongoDB connections require Node.js runtime, not Edge:
- Use `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` in API routes that use Mongoose
- Use Edge runtime only for lightweight, stateless APIs (e.g., health check)

**Why It Matters**: Prevents deployment failures, ensures database connectivity.

**Applied In**: All API routes with MongoDB queries, Phase 10.8.

## üí° Product & UX

### Gamification Thresholds

**Context**: Need to balance engagement without overwhelming users.

**Learning**: Established conservative thresholds:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: 3 games before showing premium
- **Achievement Difficulty**: Varied (5%, 20%, 50%, 80% attainment rates)
- **Daily Challenge**: 1 per day maximum (prevents fatigue)
- **Leaderboard Reset**: Weekly for engagement, all-time for prestige

**Why It Matters**: Keeps players motivated without burnout.

**Applied In**: Phase 3, Achievement design, daily challenge system.

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Version Locking Strategy

**Context**: Dependency updates can break builds unexpectedly.

**Learning**: Lock all versions in package.json (no `^` or `~`):
- Enables predictable builds
- Prevents surprise breakages
- Manual updates only after testing

**Why It Matters**: Stability over freshness for production systems.

**Applied In**: `package.json`, all 589 dependencies locked.

## üîÑ Process Improvements

### Automated Version Bumping

**Context**: Manual version updates across multiple files error-prone.

**Learning**: Create `scripts/bump-version.mjs` that:
- Updates `package.json`
- Updates all documentation files
- Commits with semantic message
- Tags git commit

**Why It Matters**: Reduces human error, enforces version protocol.

**Applied In**: Phase 0 (versioning scripts), to be implemented before Phase 2.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Avoid

### ‚ùå Breadcrumb Navigation

**Reason**: Adds visual clutter, often redundant with clear top-level nav.  
**Policy**: Explicitly prohibited by AI Rule QsC5EWsJVUi9ENlUdDdT0E.  
**Alternative**: Use clear titles, back buttons, and intuitive navigation structure.

---

### ‚ùå Hardcoding Configuration

**Reason**: Reduces reusability, makes changes require code deploys.  
**Policy**: All brand/game configuration in MongoDB, not in code.  
**Alternative**: Use `Brand` and `GameBrandConfig` models for runtime configuration.

---

### ‚ùå Uncategorized Markdown URLs

**Reason**: Warp terminal interprets `**` at end of URL as markdown formatting.  
**Policy**: Always add space after URLs or use plain text format.  
**Example**: Use `http://localhost:3000` not `http://localhost:3000**`  
**Rule**: AI Rule ivx8eJFEka2RwjImIV9xcW

---

### ‚ùå Timestamp Format Inconsistency

**Reason**: Makes sorting, parsing, and comparisons difficult.  
**Policy**: ISO 8601 with milliseconds UTC only: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`  
**Applied**: Everywhere - logs, docs, database, UI.  
**Rule**: AI Rule GgQpzJaJFBHgeBzRXQr8GG
