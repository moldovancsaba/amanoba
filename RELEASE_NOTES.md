## [v2.2.0] ‚Äî 2025-10-17 üêõ

**Status**: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Empty Leaderboards  
**Type**: Critical Fix

### üêõ Leaderboard Entries Missing gameId

**Issue**: Leaderboards displayed empty even after playing games and earning points.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Missing gameId in leaderboard entries**: Leaderboard calculator wasn't including `gameId` when creating entries
2. **API query mismatch**: Leaderboard API queried by `gameId` but entries had `null` gameId
3. **Missing guest usernames**: Anonymous login failed silently when no guest usernames existed in database

**Fix Applied**:

**Leaderboard Calculator** (`app/lib/gamification/leaderboard-calculator.ts`):
```typescript
// Added gameId parameter
export interface LeaderboardCalculationOptions {
  type: LeaderboardType;
  period: LeaderboardPeriod;
  brandId?: string;
  gameId?: string;   // NEW: game-specific leaderboard
  limit?: number;
}

// Include gameId in filter and metadata
const bulkOps = rankings.map((entry, index) => ({
  updateOne: {
    filter: {
      playerId: entry.playerId,
      metric: type,
      period,
      ...(gameId && { gameId }), // NEW
    },
    update: {
      $set: {
        value: entry.value,
        rank: index + 1,
        'metadata.lastCalculated': new Date(),
        'metadata.periodStart': dateRange.start,
        'metadata.periodEnd': dateRange.end,
      },
      $setOnInsert: {
        playerId: entry.playerId,
        ...(gameId && { gameId }), // NEW
        metric: type,
        period,
        'metadata.createdAt': new Date(),
      },
    },
    upsert: true,
  },
}));
```

**Session Manager** (`app/lib/gamification/session-manager.ts`):
```typescript
// Pass gameId when calculating leaderboards
Promise.all([
  calculateLeaderboard({
    type: 'points_balance',
    period: 'all_time',
    gameId: session.gameId.toString(), // NEW: was brandId before
    limit: 100,
  }),
  calculateLeaderboard({
    type: 'xp_total',
    period: 'all_time',
    gameId: session.gameId.toString(), // NEW
    limit: 100,
  }),
]);
```

**Guest Username Seeding**:
- Ran `npm run seed:guest-usernames` to populate 104 guest usernames
- Anonymous login now works correctly

**New Diagnostic Scripts**:
- `scripts/check-brand.ts` - Verify Brand exists
- `scripts/check-guest-usernames.ts` - Check guest username availability
- `scripts/check-player-data.ts` - Verify player data exists
- `scripts/check-sessions.ts` - Check game sessions
- `scripts/rebuild-leaderboards.ts` - Rebuild all leaderboards with proper gameId

**Files Modified**:
- `app/lib/gamification/leaderboard-calculator.ts` (lines 49-143)
- `app/lib/gamification/session-manager.ts` (lines 583-599)

**Testing**: 
- ‚úÖ Verified build passes
- ‚úÖ Guest usernames seeded (104 entries)
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard entries now include gameId
- ‚úÖ Anonymous login functional

**Impact**: 
- Players now appear on leaderboards after playing games
- Game-specific leaderboards properly track per-game rankings
- Anonymous players can log in and play

**Deployment Note**: Must redeploy application for fixes to take effect.

## [v2.1.2] ‚Äî 2025-10-17 üêõ

**Status**: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Question Repetition  
**Type**: User Experience Fix

### üêõ QUIZZZ Question Caching Bug (Same Questions Every Game)

**Issue**: Players were seeing the same 10 questions in every QUIZZZ game despite 200 questions in database.

**Root Cause**: Triple caching problem:
1. **Browser cache**: No timestamp in API URL
2. **Next.js cache**: No `cache: 'no-store'` directive in fetch
3. **HTTP cache**: No `Cache-Control` headers in API responses

**Result**: API returned cached response with same questions, even though `showCount` was incrementing in database.

**Fix Applied**:

**Frontend** (`app/games/quizzz/page.tsx`):
```typescript
// Before: Gets cached
fetch(`/api/games/quizzz/questions?difficulty=${diff}&count=${count}`)

// After: Triple cache-busting
fetch(
  `/api/games/quizzz/questions?difficulty=${diff}&count=${count}&t=${Date.now()}`,
  { cache: 'no-store' }
)
```

**Backend APIs**:
- Added `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0`
- Added `Pragma: no-cache` headers
- Applied to both `/api/games/quizzz/questions` and `/api/games/quizzz/questions/answers`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/games/quizzz/page.tsx` (lines 120-124, 142-146)
- `app/api/games/quizzz/questions/route.ts` (lines 209-213)
- `app/api/games/quizzz/questions/answers/route.ts` (lines 78-82)

**Testing**: 
- ‚úÖ Verified build passes
- ‚úÖ Each game now fetches fresh questions from database
- ‚úÖ Question rotation working correctly
- ‚úÖ All 200 questions properly distributed

**Impact**: Players now see varied questions across games, experiencing the full 200-question pool as intended.

**Learning Documented**: Added comprehensive section in LEARNINGS.md about cache-busting strategies for dynamic game content.

## [v2.1.1] ‚Äî 2025-10-17 üêõ

**Status**: BUG FIX - Challenge Progress Tracking  
**Type**: Critical Fix

### üêõ Daily Challenge Progress Timezone Bug

**Issue**: Challenge progress remained at 0/2 despite games being completed.

**Root Cause**: 
- Challenge creation API used UTC dates correctly
- Challenge tracker used **local timezone** for date queries
- Resulted in date range mismatch - challenges were never found for progress updates

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (local timezone)
const startOfDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());

// After (UTC to match challenge creation)
const startOfDay = new Date();
startOfDay.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
```

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed timezone consistency in `daily-challenge-tracker.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for challenge matching
- ‚úÖ Added progress calculation logging
- ‚úÖ Added debug logs for non-applicable challenges

**Files Modified**:
- `app/lib/gamification/daily-challenge-tracker.ts` (lines 71-75, 84-128)
- Enhanced logging throughout challenge tracking flow

**Testing**: 
- ‚úÖ Verified build passes
- ‚úÖ Challenges now update progress correctly after game completion
- ‚úÖ Timezone-independent behavior confirmed

**Impact**: Players can now complete daily challenges and see progress update in real-time.

**Status**: ENHANCEMENT - Game Content Database Migration  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement

### üóÑÔ∏è Game Content Database Migration

Migrated all hardcoded game content (QUIZZZ questions and WHACKPOP emojis) from frontend constants to MongoDB Atlas with intelligent selection algorithms and usage tracking.

---

#### **2.1.1 ‚Äî Database Models**

**QuizQuestion Model** (`app/lib/models/quiz-question.ts` - 249 lines):
- **Fields**: question, options[4], correctIndex, difficulty, category, showCount, correctCount, isActive, metadata
- **Difficulty Enum**: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD, EXPERT
- **8 Categories**: Science, History, Geography, Math, Technology, Arts & Literature, Sports, General Knowledge
- **Compound Index**: `{ difficulty: 1, isActive: 1, showCount: 1, correctCount: 1, question: 1 }`
- **Why**: Supports intelligent selection algorithm with efficient multi-field sorting

**WhackPopEmoji Model** (`app/lib/models/whackpop-emoji.ts` - 173 lines):
- **Fields**: emoji (unique), name, category, isActive, weight, metadata
- **Unique Index**: emoji field
- **Why**: Ensures emoji uniqueness and supports future weighted selection

---

#### **2.1.2 ‚Äî Seed Scripts**

**Quiz Questions Seeding** (`scripts/seed-quiz-questions.ts` - 328 lines):
- **Total Questions**: 120 (40 existing + 80 new)
- **Distribution by Difficulty**:
  - EASY: 30 questions
  - MEDIUM: 30 questions
  - HARD: 30 questions
  - EXPERT: 30 questions
- **Distribution by Category**:
  - Science: 20 questions
  - History: 20 questions
  - Geography: 15 questions
  - Math: 15 questions
  - Technology: 15 questions
  - Arts & Literature: 10 questions
  - Sports: 10 questions
  - General Knowledge: 15 questions
- **npm command**: `npm run seed:quiz-questions`
- **Why**: Provides rich question pool with balanced difficulty and category distribution

**WhackPop Emojis Seeding** (`scripts/seed-whackpop-emojis.ts` - 106 lines):
- **Total Emojis**: 8 animal emojis (üêπ üê∞ üê≠ üêª üêº üê® ü¶ä ü¶ù)
- **Names**: Hamster, Rabbit, Mouse, Bear, Panda, Koala, Fox, Raccoon
- **Category**: All Animals with weight: 1
- **npm command**: `npm run seed:whackpop-emojis`
- **Why**: Maintains existing game experience while enabling future emoji expansion

---

#### **2.1.3 ‚Äî API Endpoints**

**GET /api/games/quizzz/questions** (`app/api/games/quizzz/questions/route.ts` - 171 lines):
- **Purpose**: Intelligent question selection with usage tracking
- **Algorithm** (3-tier sorting):
  1. `showCount` ASC (prioritize least shown questions)
  2. `correctCount` ASC (prioritize harder questions)
  3. `question` ASC (alphabetical tiebreaker)
- **Query Params**: `difficulty` (EASY|MEDIUM|HARD|EXPERT), `count` (1-50)
- **Atomic Operations**: Increments `showCount` and updates `lastShownAt` for selected questions
- **Security**: Returns questions WITHOUT `correctIndex` to prevent cheating
- **Validation**: Zod schema for query parameters
- **Why**: Ensures players see varied content and naturally adjusts difficulty based on success rates

**POST /api/games/quizzz/questions/track** (`app/api/games/quizzz/questions/track/route.ts` - 151 lines):
- **Purpose**: Track correct answers to update question difficulty metrics
- **Request Body**: `questionIds[]`, `correctAnswers[]`
- **Validation**: Ensures correctAnswers are subset of questionIds
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses `bulkWrite` for efficient batch updates of `correctCount`
- **Why**: Enables adaptive difficulty by identifying which questions players find challenging

**GET /api/games/quizzz/questions/answers** (`app/api/games/quizzz/questions/answers/route.ts` - 91 lines):
- **Purpose**: Fetch correctIndex values for game logic validation
- **Query Params**: `ids` (comma-separated)
- **Returns**: Array of `{ id, correctIndex }`
- **Security Note**: MVP solution; exposes answers but acceptable for current scope
- **Why**: Separates sensitive answer data from main question API for better security posture

**GET /api/games/whackpop/emojis** (`app/api/games/whackpop/emojis/route.ts` - 106 lines):
- **Purpose**: Fetch active emojis from database
- **Query**: `{ isActive: true }`
- **Caching**: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` (1 hour)
- **Why**: Simple emoji fetching with efficient caching for rarely-changing content
